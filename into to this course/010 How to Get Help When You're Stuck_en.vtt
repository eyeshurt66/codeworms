All right guys.

1
00:01.090 --> 00:03.180
It's Angela from The App Brewery again.

2
00:03.180 --> 00:09.510
So at this stage I'm presuming that you've probably at some point in your life done a tutorial or a

3
00:09.510 --> 00:16.470
lesson somewhere else out there on the Internet and inevitably at some point you'll probably get stuck

4
00:16.530 --> 00:17.460
on a problem.

5
00:17.460 --> 00:22.890
Now I spend a lot of time thinking about how I can make the course such that you get stuck less often

6
00:23.070 --> 00:28.170
but with programming it’s almost a core part of the learning process that you do get stuck and you get

7
00:28.170 --> 00:29.540
yourself unstuck.

8
00:29.550 --> 00:34.710
So I tend to find that when I get stuck on something I try to see it as a challenge because usually

9
00:34.710 --> 00:40.800
when I solve it and when I figure it out there is a huge sense of satisfaction and there's usually some

10
00:40.800 --> 00:42.900
associated growth.

11
00:42.900 --> 00:49.530
Now having taught over 100000 students online and offline I've seen people struggle in lots of different

12
00:49.530 --> 00:50.120
ways.

13
00:50.220 --> 00:55.740
And I just wanted to summarize the steps that you can go through when you get stuck on any sort of programming

14
00:55.740 --> 01:01.090
problem and the framework that you can use to get yourself unstuck in the quickest way possible.

15
01:01.110 --> 01:07.420
Now the first step is to evaluate what is the expectation versus what is the reality.

16
01:07.440 --> 01:14.120
What did you expect your code to do or what did you expect to happen and what actually happened.

17
01:14.130 --> 01:16.310
So every time you run your code,

18
01:16.470 --> 01:22.860
think to yourself what do I expect to happen and then see what really happened and try to figure out

19
01:22.980 --> 01:24.910
what is causing the difference.

20
01:24.920 --> 01:30.870
Now while you're writing code it's inevitable that you will end up creating errors. And this can happen

21
01:30.870 --> 01:35.790
when you've made a mistake or spelled something wrong or even when you're just trying to install a piece

22
01:35.790 --> 01:42.270
of software. And those errors are usually accompanied by bits of text or the error message. And you can

23
01:42.270 --> 01:45.170
see this in your browser or in your code editor.

24
01:45.390 --> 01:50.450
And most of the time it might seem like these error messages are written by aliens because they don't

25
01:50.460 --> 01:51.820
seem to make any sense.

26
01:51.960 --> 01:59.190
But you can quite easily figure out the human meaning in English for it by just putting it into Google

27
01:59.490 --> 02:05.310
and you'll usually get lots of different answers as to what the cause might be and how you can fix the

28
02:05.310 --> 02:06.060
problem.

29
02:06.090 --> 02:11.190
And one of the web sites, if you don't already know about it, it's going to shortly become your very best

30
02:11.190 --> 02:13.900
friend, and that is stackoverflow.com.

31
02:13.950 --> 02:19.620
So I recommend searching for any errors that you come across into Google and then heading towards the

32
02:19.620 --> 02:22.530
Stack Overflow web sites that come up as a result.

33
02:22.560 --> 02:26.450
And this is exactly what real life developers do every single day.

34
02:26.610 --> 02:32.820
And in fact I've worked in teams where we will all just go to the pub and have a drink and end the day

35
02:32.910 --> 02:35.100
if Stack Overflow is no longer working.

36
02:35.100 --> 02:38.600
So it's all a part of the developer workflow.

37
02:38.610 --> 02:44.970
Now if that still doesn't help, or you’re confused by the results that you're getting back, then it's a good

38
02:44.970 --> 02:51.750
idea to re-watch some of the video up to the point when the code started breaking or it started doing

39
02:51.750 --> 02:58.200
something unexpected, because in the videos there are always step by step instructions and it's really

40
02:58.200 --> 03:04.010
important that you check to make sure that you haven't made a typo here or there or you haven't capitalized

41
03:04.010 --> 03:09.240
something that shouldn't be capitalized and just re-watch the video right before when your code broke

42
03:09.420 --> 03:11.960
in order to try and figure out what might have gone wrong.

43
03:11.970 --> 03:19.200
Now the next step is you can check your code against my code. At the end of every tutorial module,

44
03:19.200 --> 03:26.610
there is a completed project that you can download, and you can scroll through the completed code, compare

45
03:26.610 --> 03:33.450
it to your own, and see if there were any typos, any errors, any mistakes, and if it helps you can even

46
03:33.450 --> 03:39.810
copy and paste sections from the completed code into your own module just to see if that line or that

47
03:39.810 --> 03:42.530
paragraph helped to fix the issue.

48
03:42.660 --> 03:47.190
And if that still doesn't solve it then the next step is head towards the Q & A.

49
03:47.610 --> 03:55.620
So, underneath every lesson there is a Q & A section, and it's a good idea to check in the lesson when

50
03:55.620 --> 04:03.060
your app has broken to see whether if anybody else had similar issues to you. And, if you can't find anybody

51
04:03.060 --> 04:10.260
with the same issues, then ask in the Q & A. But make sure that you ask your question in the lesson

52
04:10.500 --> 04:15.810
where you're having the issue. That way it makes it much easier for other students to be able to learn

53
04:15.810 --> 04:21.450
from your mistakes and also for me to be able to quickly identify what the problem might be.

54
04:21.450 --> 04:27.630
And if you have a question about anything in the tutorial it's a good idea just to include the timestamp

55
04:27.960 --> 04:33.810
at which it occurs in the video so I can quickly watch it and figure out what you're referring to so

56
04:33.810 --> 04:35.700
that I can better answer your questions.

57
04:35.700 --> 04:41.280
Now, when you are asking questions in the Q & A, the way to get the most helpful responses and solutions

58
04:41.490 --> 04:43.480
is by following a four step approach.

59
04:43.500 --> 04:47.190
So firstly, tell us, to myself and other students,

60
04:47.190 --> 04:49.570
what did you expect to happen, then

61
04:49.620 --> 04:57.060
what actually happened, and then include a screenshot of all of your code that corresponds to this situation,

62
04:57.360 --> 05:03.010
and then include a screenshot of the debug console that includes any errors,

63
05:03.010 --> 05:05.620
if there were any errors or if your app has crashed.

64
05:05.620 --> 05:11.290
Now, to take a screenshot of part of the screen in Windows, all you have to do is hold down the Windows

65
05:11.290 --> 05:17.320
key, Shift and S, and then you'll get these little crosshairs show up and you'll be able to take a section

66
05:17.350 --> 05:23.410
of your screen as a screenshot, and, once you let go of the mouse, it will save this to your clipboard ready

67
05:23.410 --> 05:26.710
to be pasted into Paint or any other application.

68
05:27.280 --> 05:33.040
If that doesn't work for you be sure to just Google how to take a screenshot of part of the screen and

69
05:33.040 --> 05:35.660
you'll see lots of videos that can help you with this as well.

70
05:35.680 --> 05:41.380
If you're using a Mac computer, on the other hand, this shortcut is gonna save you a lot of time, and it

71
05:41.380 --> 05:47.140
might be worth noting this down in your notebook. When you use Command, Shift and 4, you get this little

72
05:47.140 --> 05:53.350
crosshair that shows up and you can start clicking and dragging the area that you want to take a screenshot

73
05:53.350 --> 06:00.760
with and it will save it automatically to your desktop, which then you can upload into the Q & A area

74
06:00.790 --> 06:01.910
for the lecture.

75
06:01.910 --> 06:09.220
So that's just a brief step by step process on what to do and how to get help when you get stuck and

76
06:09.220 --> 06:12.610
it's important to remember that everybody gets stuck sometimes.

77
06:12.610 --> 06:19.060
I've spent days trying to find a bug in my code and it turns out to be just a comma that was misplaced

78
06:19.330 --> 06:26.170
or a semicolon that was accidentally deleted, and one of the greatest joys, for me anyways, is figuring

79
06:26.170 --> 06:32.980
out these problems and fixing them. So don't worry if you do get stuck. Everybody will try to help you.

80
06:33.100 --> 06:38.470
And just remember that getting stuck and solving it is all a part of the learning journey.
