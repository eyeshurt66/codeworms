Hi guys, it's Angela from the App Brewery. And in this lesson,

1
00:03.540 --> 00:08.400
we're going to deep dive into how exactly does the internet actually work

2
00:08.550 --> 00:12.780
because here's this thing that we use every single day and we completely take it

3
00:12.780 --> 00:13.613
for granted.

4
00:13.650 --> 00:18.240
So before we start developing awesome websites and web apps for people to access

5
00:18.240 --> 00:19.073
through the internet,

6
00:19.170 --> 00:23.040
it's really important that we understand the fundamentals of how the internet

7
00:23.220 --> 00:27.990
actually works. So what exactly is the internet? Well,

8
00:27.990 --> 00:30.360
a lot of people think of it as a cloud,

9
00:30.600 --> 00:33.870
something that's hanging around in the sky, it's super complex,

10
00:33.870 --> 00:37.530
super difficult to understand, but actually that's not it at all.

11
00:37.800 --> 00:39.390
The internet is really simple.

12
00:39.540 --> 00:44.540
All it is is just a long piece of wire and the wire connects different computers

13
00:45.600 --> 00:46.433
to each other.

14
00:46.710 --> 00:51.030
So you might have one computer that's in Seattle and another computer that's in

15
00:51.030 --> 00:51.750
London,

16
00:51.750 --> 00:56.550
and they can talk to each other and transfer data through this giant wire. Now,

17
00:56.580 --> 01:01.110
some of these computers attached to the internet have a very special job.

18
01:01.200 --> 01:03.570
They have to be online 24/7

19
01:03.900 --> 01:08.900
ready to serve you all of the data and the files that you are requesting when

20
01:09.060 --> 01:12.720
you try to access websites and the computers that are doing that job,

21
01:12.960 --> 01:17.550
we would call a server and the computers that any user would you use to access

22
01:17.550 --> 01:19.290
the internet is called a client.

23
01:19.380 --> 01:24.210
Now you can imagine a web server as a giant library, that's open 24/7,

24
01:24.390 --> 01:27.690
and you can go in there at any hour of the day and request

25
01:27.750 --> 01:29.550
I want to see Google's homepage,

26
01:29.610 --> 01:31.950
or I want to see the latest post on Techcrunch.

27
01:32.250 --> 01:36.120
And it would be able to serve you with all of the files and data that you would

28
01:36.120 --> 01:40.050
need to be able to view whatever website it is that you requested.

29
01:40.380 --> 01:44.670
Now you can imagine if there's a library that's big enough to house all of these

30
01:44.670 --> 01:45.420
websites,

31
01:45.420 --> 01:49.290
then it's going to be pretty difficult to quickly locate the thing that you want

32
01:49.590 --> 01:53.970
out of this giant library, right? So how is this problem solved on the internet?

33
01:54.270 --> 01:54.510
Well,

34
01:54.510 --> 01:59.460
let's say that you're sitting at home on your computer and you type in google.com because

35
01:59.460 --> 02:02.160
you want to head over to the main Google homepage.

36
02:02.670 --> 02:07.670
What happens behind the scenes is that your browser will send a message to your

37
02:07.770 --> 02:09.270
internet service provider.

38
02:09.480 --> 02:13.170
So these are the people who you pay to be able to access the internet.

39
02:13.500 --> 02:17.580
And if you're in the US that's a company like AT&T or Comcast,

40
02:17.820 --> 02:21.030
and if you're in the UK, then that would be something like BT or Talk Talk.

41
02:21.150 --> 02:26.150
Now the message that you're sending the ISP is I want to see google.com and the

42
02:26.640 --> 02:31.640
ISP will then relay that message to something called a DNS server,

43
02:32.130 --> 02:34.320
a domain name system server.

44
02:34.710 --> 02:38.100
And a DNS server is essentially just a souped up phonebook.

45
02:38.580 --> 02:43.580
And what happens when you make that request through your browser is the DNS

46
02:43.620 --> 02:48.620
server will look up in its database as to what is the exact IP address

47
02:49.800 --> 02:52.170
of that website that you are trying to access.

48
02:52.410 --> 02:57.410
And every single computer that's connected to the internet has an IP address.

49
02:57.720 --> 03:00.790
This is like a postal for your computer

50
03:01.000 --> 03:04.290
so that when people need to send and receive files on the internet

51
03:04.410 --> 03:08.460
each computer can be located by their unique IP address.

52
03:08.760 --> 03:11.550
And once the DNS server finds the IP address,

53
03:11.820 --> 03:15.720
it sends that back to your browser. So now, you know

54
03:15.720 --> 03:19.620
the exact address where you can find the Google homepage.

55
03:19.980 --> 03:24.980
The next thing that happens is you will send a direct request to that address

56
03:25.440 --> 03:27.180
through your internet service provider.

57
03:27.270 --> 03:32.010
And this message will be delivered via what's called the internet backbone.

58
03:32.220 --> 03:33.600
Now the internet backbone

59
03:33.630 --> 03:36.720
isn't some sort of analogy for some clever Programming.

60
03:36.990 --> 03:39.720
It's literally the backbone of the internet.

61
03:40.110 --> 03:43.170
And if you head over the submarinecablemap.com,

62
03:43.560 --> 03:45.540
you can view all of the

63
03:45.900 --> 03:50.900
underwater cables that power the internet. And the internet is made up of these

64
03:51.420 --> 03:54.120
huge sprawling masses of wires

65
03:54.210 --> 03:58.050
connecting all of the world's internet users. As you can imagine,

66
03:58.080 --> 04:00.540
it's a pretty complex world out there. Now,

67
04:00.570 --> 04:05.570
if I'm sitting in London and I want to see a website that's hosted in the

68
04:05.940 --> 04:06.960
United States,

69
04:07.110 --> 04:11.160
then my browser would have to make a request that goes through one of these

70
04:11.160 --> 04:15.390
cables under the Atlantic ocean in order to reach the United States.

71
04:15.540 --> 04:18.120
And once that computer has received my request,

72
04:18.360 --> 04:21.420
they'll send back all of the relevant data, again,

73
04:21.450 --> 04:26.400
through these giant cables. And to navigate all of this crazy underwater and

74
04:26.400 --> 04:30.360
above water wires, all I have is an IP address.

75
04:30.450 --> 04:33.690
It's like as if I'm sending a letter halfway across the world

76
04:34.020 --> 04:38.910
and my only hope for my letter to reach my friend is that postal address on the

77
04:38.910 --> 04:39.900
front of the envelope.

78
04:39.990 --> 04:44.160
So once I've gotten the IP address of the website that I want to access,

79
04:44.520 --> 04:49.520
then my browser sends another message through the internet service provider via

80
04:49.560 --> 04:51.240
the internet backbone to

81
04:51.420 --> 04:56.190
the server that is located at that address 216.58

82
04:56.190 --> 04:58.050
210.46.

83
04:58.380 --> 05:03.090
And the computer that's located at that address is of course the Google server.

84
05:03.540 --> 05:05.030
And on the server there's

85
05:05.190 --> 05:09.270
all of the files that I would need in order to be able to view the Google

86
05:09.270 --> 05:10.103
homepage.

87
05:10.470 --> 05:14.340
The server then sends all of those files back to me through the internet

88
05:14.340 --> 05:17.760
backbone and I get to see the Google homepage in my browser.

89
05:17.940 --> 05:21.750
And all of that happens in a matter of milliseconds.

90
05:21.900 --> 05:26.250
And just to imagine the journey that my data has gone on traveling through the

91
05:26.250 --> 05:28.140
world thousands of times per day.

92
05:28.380 --> 05:32.340
So why don't you give it a go? Open up your browser and type in 

93
05:32.340 --> 05:35.400
216.58.210.46,

94
05:35.850 --> 05:40.850
and hit enter to see the Google homepage being served up to you through the

95
05:40.920 --> 05:41.340
internet.
