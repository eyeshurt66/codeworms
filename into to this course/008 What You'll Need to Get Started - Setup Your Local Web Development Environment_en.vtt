00:00.660 --> 00:06.390
All right, so first things first. Before we do anything else, we first have to get set up and ready

1
00:06.390 --> 00:07.560
for web development.

2
00:07.860 --> 00:14.010
So I'm going to walk you through a couple of applications that we'll be using pretty much full-time during

3
00:14.010 --> 00:14.610
this course.

4
00:15.150 --> 00:22.050
There's two major tools that we'll rely on, and that is going to be the Chrome browser and the Atom

5
00:22.060 --> 00:22.860
text editor.

6
00:23.130 --> 00:28.320
And between these two tools, we're going to achieve a lot. Later on in the course when we're introducing

7
00:28.320 --> 00:34.260
more advanced concepts such as using the command line or using a database, then we'll install other

8
00:34.260 --> 00:35.460
things as we go along.

9
00:35.670 --> 00:40.530
But to get started, the most important applications we need to install are just these two.

10
00:41.310 --> 00:47.370
Now you might already have Chrome installed, but if you don't, then be sure to check out the Web Development

11
00:47.370 --> 00:51.960
Course Resources list, which I'll link to in this current lesson.

12
00:52.260 --> 00:56.850
And it's really, really important that you check over here because every single time I mention a

13
00:56.860 --> 01:01.860
link or every single time I try to point you towards something, the link will show up over here and

14
01:01.860 --> 01:06.150
you'll be able to click on it to save you all the trouble of having to type it all out.

15
01:07.050 --> 01:14.190
Open up this page in your browser and just click on this link to go ahead and download and install Chrome.

16
01:14.820 --> 01:18.060
And that should be pretty simple, and it will guide you through the process.

17
01:18.660 --> 01:21.090
Now, if you're wondering, do I have to use Chrome?

18
01:21.100 --> 01:25.080
What if I already have Firefox installed, or what if I want to use Safari?

19
01:25.380 --> 01:27.510
Normally, I would say that's completely fine.

20
01:27.840 --> 01:32.520
But in this case, because we're going to use some of the developer tools inside Chrome, and I want

21
01:32.520 --> 01:36.240
you to be able to do it step by step along with me while watching the videos,

22
01:36.540 --> 01:39.840
it's best in this case to just simply download and use Chrome.

23
01:40.080 --> 01:45.270
So now that you've downloaded the browser you need, the next step is to install a code editor.

24
01:45.720 --> 01:53.460
And out there, there are so many different code editors, for example, Atom or VSCode, Sublime, Brackets.

25
01:53.790 --> 02:00.120
And if you think about it, all that you need to actually write code is just some form of text editor.

26
02:00.360 --> 02:04.680
So you could, if you really wanted to, even use something like notepad.

27
02:05.160 --> 02:11.280
But the downside of Notepad is it doesn't have all of the great features that some of these other specialized

28
02:11.280 --> 02:12.330
code editors have.

29
02:12.780 --> 02:17.880
So two of my favorites are Atom and VScode and I use both of them pretty regularly.

30
02:18.300 --> 02:20.910
Now, in the course videos, you'll see me use Atom.

31
02:21.180 --> 02:26.700
But if you have a strong preference towards any other code editor that you're already used to that you

32
02:26.700 --> 02:29.250
want to use instead, then feel free to do that.

33
02:29.550 --> 02:34.920
But if you are a complete beginner to programming, then I recommend we go ahead and install the Atom

34
02:34.920 --> 02:35.640
text editor.

35
02:36.090 --> 02:39.210
And it's completely free to download and install.

36
02:39.450 --> 02:45.990
So if you just head over to atom.io or go through the Web Development Course resource list, then

37
02:45.990 --> 02:51.690
you should land on this page. And it very cleverly figures out what system you have that you're running.

38
02:51.900 --> 02:57.150
Now, if you're a Windows user and you head over to atom.io, you'll see that it automatically

39
02:57.150 --> 03:03.240
detects that you are viewing this on a Windows computer and then you can just go ahead and again, click

40
03:03.240 --> 03:08.520
that big yellow download button and you should end up with something that's called something like atom

41
03:08.820 --> 03:13.470
setup.exe. And you'll be able to see this in your downloads folder.

42
03:14.490 --> 03:20.070
So now if you just double click on that and it will automatically do everything it needs to install

43
03:20.070 --> 03:21.510
Atom on your system.

44
03:22.230 --> 03:28.830
So once you're done, it should open up a new Atom window like so and you would have successfully installed

45
03:28.830 --> 03:29.310
Atom.

46
03:29.730 --> 03:35.490
So now as a Windows user, you are done installing Chrome and Atom, and you can head over to the next

47
03:35.490 --> 03:42.270
lesson where we install some packages to power up our Atom code editor. For a Mac user,

48
03:42.270 --> 03:45.090
continue listening and I'm going to show you the same process

49
03:45.300 --> 03:50.070
but on macOS. So all you have to do is just go ahead and click download.

50
03:51.120 --> 03:56.430
And once download has completed, then you can simply head over to your downloads folder and double

51
03:56.430 --> 03:58.650
click to unzip that package.

52
04:00.330 --> 04:02.710
And now you will see Atom  show up.

53
04:02.730 --> 04:09.480
The last thing you have to do is just to move this application into your applications folder. On the

54
04:09.480 --> 04:09.750
Mac

55
04:09.750 --> 04:14.460
it's just a matter of heading over to your Macintosh hard drive and then your applications folder and

56
04:14.460 --> 04:22.650
then dragging in that atom application that you just downloaded in your downloads over into here. And

57
04:22.650 --> 04:25.410
then you're all done and you're set up with Atom.

58
04:26.580 --> 04:31.710
So now that you've got Chrome and Atom installed, head over to the next lesson and we're going to start

59
04:31.710 --> 04:37.830
exploring Atom packages and see the ways that we can stop powering up our Atom code editor.
