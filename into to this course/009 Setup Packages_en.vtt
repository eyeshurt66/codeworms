So now that we've installed Atom, the next step is to power it up with packages. So you can see that

1
00:06.780 --> 00:13.230
they have over 8000 packages, which are bunches of code that other programmers have written to make

2
00:13.230 --> 00:15.900
your experience of using Atom better.

3
00:16.170 --> 00:21.380
So what we're about to do is a bit like that 90s MTV show Pimp My Ride.

4
00:21.420 --> 00:26.880
We're going to improve our code editor using these additional components and add-ons.

5
00:27.060 --> 00:30.000
It's almost like upgrading the sound system to our car.

6
00:30.510 --> 00:36.450
Now, the simplest thing for us to do when we want to install a package is to simply open up Atom

7
00:36.810 --> 00:43.290
and in the welcome guide here, you should be able to see this "Install a Package" section, which we

8
00:43.290 --> 00:47.010
can click on and then we can click on "Open installer"

9
00:47.280 --> 00:50.940
and that will take us to the correct position in the Settings menu.

10
00:51.780 --> 00:57.090
Now, if you're on Windows and you want to be able to navigate back to here, the easiest way is to

11
00:57.090 --> 01:00.090
go to file and then go to settings.

12
01:00.420 --> 01:03.870
And then you'll find the same panel and you can click on install.

13
01:04.500 --> 01:10.830
And in order to install the packages, all we have to do is to type their name into the search bar,

14
01:11.130 --> 01:18.630
and then it will search the entire library of packages and we're able to install, uninstall or change

15
01:18.630 --> 01:19.290
its settings.

16
01:19.620 --> 01:24.900
So again, if you head back over to the web development course resource list, you'll see that there is

17
01:24.900 --> 01:28.710
a list of Atom packages that we want you to install.

18
01:29.110 --> 01:34.200
And these are the ones which are recommended, and these are the ones which are optional.

19
01:35.010 --> 01:42.570
And then if you search for each of these packages, for example, starting with atom-ternjs, then

20
01:42.570 --> 01:47.580
you should be able to find and install these packages into your Atom code editor.

21
01:48.000 --> 01:54.090
And if you have any problems at all during the installation process, take a look back at that Google

22
01:54.090 --> 01:57.930
Drive document where we've got troubleshooting tips and advice as well.

23
01:59.490 --> 02:07.670
So now, as a Windows user, you are done installing Atom, installing Chrome and also the Atom packages,

24
02:07.680 --> 02:11.730
and you can safely skip the rest of the video and continue to the next lesson.

25
02:12.300 --> 02:19.590
Now, if you are a Mac user, all you have to do is open up Atom and go to preferences and then go to

26
02:19.590 --> 02:20.340
install.

27
02:20.670 --> 02:27.450
And I want you to search for each of these and then just go ahead and install it. So you can simply just

28
02:27.450 --> 02:28.950
copy and paste it into here

29
02:29.250 --> 02:34.590
and you'll see the one that should match up exactly with the name that you see over here and then just

30
02:34.590 --> 02:36.450
go ahead and click install.

31
02:37.110 --> 02:42.810
Similarly, if you had any problems installing the packages, I recommend heading over to that Google

32
02:42.810 --> 02:48.300
Drive doc that I linked to in the course resources and take a look through the troubleshooting steps

33
02:48.420 --> 02:51.630
and see if they can help you to resolve any issues that you have.

34
02:52.050 --> 02:57.150
And then once you're done, you've finished all the installation steps and we can get started by heading

35
02:57.150 --> 02:58.230
over to the next lesson.
