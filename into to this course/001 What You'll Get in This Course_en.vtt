Hello and welcome to the world's best web development course.

1
00:09.460 --> 00:10.630
My name is Angela,

2
00:10.870 --> 00:17.980
I'm a senior developer and the lead instructor at the London App Brewery, London's highest-rated programming

3
00:17.980 --> 00:18.550
bootcamp.

4
00:18.790 --> 00:25.540
To date, I've taught over a million students worldwide, in-person and online.

5
00:26.140 --> 00:31.330
And today I'm so excited that I have the privilege to be your instructor on this course.

6
00:31.690 --> 00:36.850
You're going to get access to over 55 hours of HD video content,

7
00:37.540 --> 00:44.170
step by step tutorials, interactive coding exercises, quizzes and much, much more.

8
00:44.680 --> 00:52.450
This course is created with the same curriculum as our 12-week in-person programming BootCamp. So that

9
00:52.450 --> 01:00.220
means you can look forward to the same professional level content covering every aspect of web development

10
01:00.580 --> 01:02.560
from HTML to React.

11
01:02.650 --> 01:11.110
This is the only course you need to become a professional, full-stack web developer. And the best part,

12
01:11.770 --> 01:17.320
the course is completely project-based, so that means you're going to learn everything you need to

13
01:17.320 --> 01:22.780
know while building beautiful real-world websites and web applications.

14
01:23.080 --> 01:28.480
You'll build a beautiful product website using HTML, CSS and bootstrap.

15
01:28.840 --> 01:32.050
You'll build games and musical apps like this drum kit.

16
01:32.500 --> 01:38.710
You'll learn about Node, React and the MERN stack to build classic developer projects like a to-do list

17
01:38.710 --> 01:44.140
app and a project manager that's perfect for showing off at your next interview.

18
01:44.620 --> 01:49.240
If you're curious, take a look at the downloadable curriculum to learn more.

19
01:49.540 --> 01:54.520
Now, this course assumes absolutely no prior programming experience.

20
01:54.970 --> 02:01.900
So if you're a complete beginner, I'll be there every step of the way, taking you from programming

21
02:01.900 --> 02:06.850
fundamentals all the way through to intermediate and more advanced concepts.

22
02:07.030 --> 02:12.520
Now, if you're an advanced developer, then take a look at the curriculum and start at the level that

23
02:12.520 --> 02:13.390
suits you best.

24
02:13.630 --> 02:21.100
So instead of spending $12,000 on an in-person Bootcamp and having to take time off work, you're going

25
02:21.100 --> 02:27.490
to get access to exactly the same curriculum that has years of design and testing behind it.

26
02:28.090 --> 02:32.260
So you won't just know what to do, but also why you're doing it.

27
02:32.980 --> 02:35.080
