00:00.390 --> 00:04.710
So now that we understand how the HTML boilerplate works and what each line

1
00:04.710 --> 00:05.550
does in it,

2
00:05.790 --> 00:09.840
it's time to move into the body section and start giving our website some

3
00:09.840 --> 00:14.370
content cause at the moment, our website is looking a little bit plain.

4
00:14.610 --> 00:16.740
So if we have a look at Jon Kleinberg's website,

5
00:16.860 --> 00:21.860
the first thing that we want right at the top here is a level one heading that

6
00:21.960 --> 00:26.550
says our name. So let's hit back into Atom and as a challenge 

7
00:26.550 --> 00:31.260
to you, add a level one heading inside the body section of your website that

8
00:31.290 --> 00:32.940
contains your name.

9
00:38.090 --> 00:43.090
So this one's easy and it's made even easier using the auto complete features

10
00:43.730 --> 00:47.990
inside Atom. All have to write in order to create an h1 tag,

11
00:48.050 --> 00:51.710
which is what's needed to create a level one heading, is I just have to write

12
00:51.770 --> 00:54.770
h1 and it makes a suggestion asking me,

13
00:55.100 --> 00:59.780
are you looking for heading level one? And now if I hit enter, or if I hit tab,

14
01:00.140 --> 01:05.140
I get the h1 tag inserted automatically, opened and closed for me

15
01:06.020 --> 01:10.520
and my cursor gets moved right in between exactly the place where I would need

16
01:10.520 --> 01:11.480
to start typing.

17
01:12.260 --> 01:17.260
So now if I hit save and I head back over to my personal site,

18
01:17.810 --> 01:19.700
and remember if you close down this tab,

19
01:19.940 --> 01:23.600
you can always go into your Finder or your Explorer to open it back up again

20
01:23.810 --> 01:28.810
or you can select the full file path from Atom as well and paste it into here.

21
01:29.540 --> 01:32.360
Now, if I hit enter, you can see my h1,

22
01:32.390 --> 01:35.990
my level one heading gets shown up here just like John Kleinberg's

23
01:36.080 --> 01:38.450
and we're ready to move on to the next thing.

24
01:38.870 --> 01:43.820
Now we want to have a line that shows our title, so who it is that we are.

25
01:44.330 --> 01:46.730
Let's head back to Atom. And firstly,

26
01:46.730 --> 01:49.760
I'm going to get rid of this little heart because it doesn't look very

27
01:49.760 --> 01:50.593
professional

28
01:51.020 --> 01:55.550
and I'm going to add another HTML element under the h1.

29
01:56.180 --> 02:01.180
And this is a good point to talk about how to keep your HTML file neat and tidy.

30
02:01.340 --> 02:01.940
Now,

31
02:01.940 --> 02:06.940
most programs are very serious about how to indent and structure their HTML

32
02:08.240 --> 02:09.073
files.

33
02:09.110 --> 02:13.790
And the reason for it is because having these indents makes it easy for us to

34
02:13.790 --> 02:18.260
see at a glance, which tags are inside other ones.

35
02:18.290 --> 02:18.920
So for example,

36
02:18.920 --> 02:23.360
if we look at the top level here and we've got the HTML tag and because both the

37
02:23.360 --> 02:28.360
head and the body tags are i dented inside these HTML tags,

38
02:29.930 --> 02:34.930
it shows us at a glance that the head is inside the HTML element and as is

39
02:37.190 --> 02:42.080
the body. But the body and the head they're at the same hierarchical level.

40
02:42.290 --> 02:44.630
They're not inside of each other at all.

41
02:45.230 --> 02:49.580
And this is a good structure for us to be able to see at a glance what's

42
02:49.580 --> 02:53.690
happening in our code. And also when other programmers look at our code,

43
02:53.780 --> 02:56.060
because we're used to working with the same structure,

44
02:56.480 --> 02:59.920
it's easy to be able to understand what's going at a glance.

45
03:00.340 --> 03:05.340
So you can see that there's one part of our code that breaks this rule.

46
03:05.950 --> 03:07.780
And that's this line here.

47
03:08.320 --> 03:12.010
Our h1 is contained inside our body element

48
03:12.280 --> 03:16.360
and so it should be indented like so.

49
03:16.720 --> 03:21.720
And you can clearly see that this is now a child or contained inside the body

50
03:21.880 --> 03:26.590
tag. Now, if you didn't want to do that manually every single time,

51
03:26.680 --> 03:27.400
well,

52
03:27.400 --> 03:31.720
we actually installed a package right at the beginning that helps us with this

53
03:31.840 --> 03:34.690
organization. It's our little housekeeper, if you will.

54
03:34.870 --> 03:38.410
So if you go to packages and go to Atom Beautify

55
03:38.680 --> 03:40.120
and click on beautify,

56
03:40.540 --> 03:45.540
it will automatically beautify your entire code file to make all of the indents

57
03:45.610 --> 03:48.730
for you and to make everything look neat and tidy.

58
03:49.210 --> 03:52.330
So every so often, once your code starts getting messy,

59
03:52.510 --> 03:57.490
either learn the shortcut or go through it in the menu and reorganize your code

60
03:57.490 --> 04:00.730
file. It'll make it much easier on the eyes and much easier to read.

61
04:00.940 --> 04:05.680
So now I want to add my title under my h1 tag.

62
04:06.100 --> 04:08.830
And for this, I'm going to use the P tag,

63
04:09.160 --> 04:14.160
which is a paragraph tag and the P tag formats text into a paragraph.

64
04:15.400 --> 04:20.230
So they get a new line and the text inside gets grouped together into the same

65
04:20.230 --> 04:23.230
paragraph. So let's add my title here,

66
04:23.880 --> 04:24.713
<v 1>yeah.</v>

67
04:28.470 --> 04:32.340
<v 0>And now let's see what our changes look like. So remember again,</v>

68
04:32.370 --> 04:37.370
command +s or control + s to save and head back over to our site and command + r or

69
04:38.250 --> 04:43.170
control + r to refresh or click this button to refresh. And there we go.

70
04:43.230 --> 04:47.400
There's our brand new paragraph showing up. Now, if we look at Jon Kleinberg,

71
04:47.400 --> 04:52.400
so you can see that his title is italicized and ours is not.

72
04:53.370 --> 04:57.870
So how can we make ours italicized as well? Well, this is where our lessons

73
04:57.870 --> 04:59.880
on documentation is going to come in handy.

74
05:00.360 --> 05:05.360
Let's go ahead and go to Google and see if you can find out how do to italicize

75
05:05.910 --> 05:08.850
your text using HTML.

76
05:12.480 --> 05:12.630
<v 1>Go on.</v>

77
05:12.630 --> 05:16.680
<v 0>Let's write italicize HTML MDN</v>

78
05:17.700 --> 05:18.690
and let's hit enter.

79
05:19.530 --> 05:22.440
And you can see that there's actually two tags that come up here

80
05:22.770 --> 05:26.310
and the first one that comes up is this one. So let's have a look at it first.

81
05:27.090 --> 05:30.900
Now this is the em or the emphasis element

82
05:31.200 --> 05:35.040
and it marks text that has a stress emphasis.

83
05:35.160 --> 05:37.470
Now it looks like this in practice

84
05:37.830 --> 05:41.070
and the result is that it makes it look italicized.

85
05:41.790 --> 05:43.770
Now you might have noticed back here,

86
05:43.770 --> 05:47.130
we also had the i element or the i tag

87
05:47.340 --> 05:49.590
and it does the same thing visually.

88
05:49.770 --> 05:54.420
It also makes the text that's in between the i  tags italicized.

89
05:54.990 --> 05:59.000
But there;s a little bit of a difference here and the difference is quite subtle.

90
05:59.150 --> 06:03.740
The emphasis tag tells the browser the words that are enclosed between it

91
06:04.070 --> 06:07.010
should be stressed or should be emphasized,

92
06:07.100 --> 06:11.060
but the i tag only italicizes the text.

93
06:11.090 --> 06:14.810
So it only styles the text to make it slanted

94
06:15.140 --> 06:18.920
and it doesn't confer any of that emphasis. And for this reason,

95
06:19.130 --> 06:23.510
it's good practice to always use emphasis instead of italic

96
06:23.720 --> 06:25.730
because it conveys more information

97
06:26.240 --> 06:28.730
and it isn't just about the style.

98
06:29.150 --> 06:33.320
Remember when we're writing HTML code we're more concerned about structuring our

99
06:33.320 --> 06:38.320
text rather than caring about how it looks or how it appears. Now a similar pair

100
06:39.710 --> 06:43.160
is the B tag or the bold tag,

101
06:43.550 --> 06:45.380
and this is equivalent to the i tag.

102
06:45.650 --> 06:49.760
It makes any texts that's in between bolded like so.

103
06:50.240 --> 06:54.140
But instead, what you should be using is the strong tag.

104
06:54.560 --> 06:57.440
And that's because the strong tag, again, confers

105
06:57.500 --> 07:02.500
meaning. It says that this text has strong importance and therefore it's

106
07:03.230 --> 07:08.090
displayed in bold rather than merely saying that this should be styled so that

107
07:08.090 --> 07:12.560
it's darker than the rest of the text. And if you're interested,

108
07:12.590 --> 07:17.330
you can have a read between bold and strong, as well as emphasis and strong,

109
07:17.600 --> 07:19.280
as well as emphasis and italic.

110
07:19.550 --> 07:22.880
It makes for some interesting reading and gives you a bit more background

111
07:22.880 --> 07:25.580
information on the different between these two tags.

112
07:25.820 --> 07:28.670
But whenever you're looking to make something bold in your website,

113
07:28.970 --> 07:30.950
you should probably be using the strong tag.

114
07:31.070 --> 07:33.140
And whenever you want to make something italicize,

115
07:33.410 --> 07:35.570
you should be using the emphasis tag.

116
07:36.470 --> 07:39.800
So let's go ahead and make our paragraph,

117
07:40.130 --> 07:44.540
this title, italicized or emphasized like

118
07:44.540 --> 07:46.220
so. If you remember,

119
07:46.250 --> 07:50.780
all we have to do is just to enclose it inside the em tag.

120
07:52.190 --> 07:55.220
Now you can do that for the entire length of the text,

121
07:55.370 --> 07:59.630
or you can simply apply it to just a section of the text. So for example,

122
07:59.630 --> 08:03.260
if I wanted to make the part where it says the App Brewery bolded,

123
08:03.560 --> 08:07.190
then I can simply add a strong tag and have the App

124
08:07.190 --> 08:11.780
Brewery not including the full stop inside this strong tag. Now,

125
08:11.780 --> 08:14.690
if I hit save and go ahead and refresh,

126
08:14.870 --> 08:19.870
then you can see that the entire paragraph is emphasized and the App Brewery is

127
08:22.070 --> 08:25.550
bolded. So we've done a little bit of formatting for our website.

128
08:26.090 --> 08:27.680
Now let's move on to the next part.

129
08:27.920 --> 08:31.700
We're going to add a little bio here and that again is going to be inside a

130
08:31.700 --> 08:36.050
paragraph element, and it just tells anybody who's visiting our personal site

131
08:36.320 --> 08:39.770
who we are and what we're all about. So once you're ready,

132
08:39.830 --> 08:43.850
go ahead and figure out where you should add this and complete the challenge.

133
08:46.070 --> 08:50.030
OK. So that wasn't so hard. All we have to do is just indent,

134
08:50.060 --> 08:51.590
so we're in the right position,

135
08:51.590 --> 08:55.470
we're inside the body tag. And we're going to create a new paragraph element.

136
08:55.740 --> 08:59.700
So this is going to be on a new line from this paragraph.

137
08:59.760 --> 09:03.270
They are going to be separate paragraphs and here I'm going to write

138
09:03.330 --> 09:07.830
I am an iOS and web developer.

139
09:08.220 --> 09:11.340
I love coffee

140
09:12.750 --> 09:16.410
and brew my own beers.

141
09:16.740 --> 09:20.580
Let's save and check it out here. All right. It looks pretty good

142
09:20.670 --> 09:24.000
and we're getting pretty far already. So obviously you can put as much

143
09:24.120 --> 09:26.850
or as little as you want here and design your website

144
09:26.850 --> 09:29.280
however you want it to look. Now,

145
09:29.280 --> 09:32.070
the next thing I want to add is this horizontal line.

146
09:32.430 --> 09:34.110
And we've done that previously.

147
09:34.380 --> 09:39.120
So you can go ahead and add that into your code file as a challenge.

148
09:39.410 --> 09:40.243
<v 1>Go on.</v>

149
09:42.170 --> 09:44.570
<v 0>All right. So do you remember how to do that? Well,</v>

150
09:44.600 --> 09:48.020
all we need to do is we're still staying inside the body because we're creating

151
09:48.020 --> 09:49.550
the content for our website.

152
09:50.030 --> 09:53.750
And all we need to do is just to create a horizontal rule.

153
09:53.780 --> 09:57.410
So I'm going to use my good friend autosuggest and I'm going to right hr and

154
09:57.410 --> 10:00.770
hit enter to insert a new horizontal rule.

155
10:01.100 --> 10:04.520
And now it's looking pretty similar to what we've got here. Now,

156
10:04.520 --> 10:09.520
the last thing I want to add is a subtitle where I'm going to list all the books

157
10:09.980 --> 10:12.950
and courses that I'm teaching. Go ahead

158
10:13.010 --> 10:14.990
and add a level three

159
10:14.990 --> 10:19.990
heading to your website underneath the horizontal rule and call it books and

160
10:20.690 --> 10:22.970
teaching. Or if you don't have any books and teaching,

161
10:23.180 --> 10:27.560
you can simply call it education and list all the schools that you've attended.

162
10:28.130 --> 10:28.963
<v 1>Okay.</v>

163
10:32.600 --> 10:36.230
<v 0>All right. Underneath the horizontal rule, I'm going to add an h3</v>

164
10:36.260 --> 10:37.430
so a level three heading,

165
10:37.640 --> 10:41.510
and this is going to be the books and teaching.

166
10:42.740 --> 10:43.070
All right.

167
10:43.070 --> 10:47.180
So we've already got most of our personal site coded up. In the next lesson,

168
10:47.210 --> 10:51.830
we're going to be diving into HTML lists and how we can create these bullet

169
10:51.830 --> 10:55.970
points as well as numbered points and add it  to our website.

170
10:56.360 --> 11:00.080
So, all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
