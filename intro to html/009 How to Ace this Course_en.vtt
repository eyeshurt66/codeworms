Well done 

1
00:01.380 --> 00:08.970
for completing the first module. You've already come so far just by taking the first step, because

2
00:09.210 --> 00:13.910
you know that most people who buy online courses, they never get started.

3
00:14.580 --> 00:17.870
So you're already one step closer to your goal.

4
00:18.750 --> 00:23.820
But we all know that at some point later on, things will get more difficult.

5
00:23.970 --> 00:25.440
It will get more challenging.

6
00:25.470 --> 00:27.010
I can promise you this already.

7
00:27.540 --> 00:33.450
So how can you keep this current level of motivation that you have and be able to carry it through to

8
00:33.450 --> 00:34.380
the difficult times?

9
00:35.220 --> 00:42.300
One of the things that I find really helpful is setting goals and having my goals around me, like displayed

10
00:42.300 --> 00:45.260
on the wall while I'm working or while I'm studying.

11
00:45.780 --> 00:53.220
So I've created this fantastic worksheet for you so that you can start thinking about why you're doing

12
00:53.220 --> 00:53.700
this.

13
00:53.850 --> 00:55.430
Why are you learning to code?

14
00:55.470 --> 00:57.240
Why are you learning the skill?

15
00:57.810 --> 01:00.540
What will you be able to achieve once you've mastered it?

16
01:00.750 --> 01:03.600
And what would your life look like once that happens?

17
01:04.260 --> 01:06.120
So head over to the next lesson,

18
01:06.390 --> 01:12.750
fill out the sheet with your answers and then print it out and put it somewhere where you can see it

19
01:13.410 --> 01:18.780
so that when things become difficult and when your motivation takes a nosedive, you can have a look

20
01:18.780 --> 01:22.840
at it and remind yourself of why you're doing it in the first place.

21
01:23.160 --> 01:24.420
So head over there now.
