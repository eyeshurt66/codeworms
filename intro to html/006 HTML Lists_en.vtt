00:00.360 --> 00:00.810
All right.

1
00:00.810 --> 00:05.810
So in the last lesson we created the start of our beautiful,

2
00:06.150 --> 00:10.740
personal and website and we're modeling off Jon Kleinberg's homepage.

3
00:11.130 --> 00:14.220
So the next step that we want to achieve is this.

4
00:14.430 --> 00:19.430
How do we put in a bullet list into our website so that we can list maybe the

5
00:20.370 --> 00:23.220
books and courses that we're teaching in my case,

6
00:23.460 --> 00:27.060
or it could be your education background, which schools you attended,

7
00:27.180 --> 00:31.290
what degrees you attained, what courses you've completed, et cetera?

8
00:31.410 --> 00:33.750
So that's the next challenge. If you want,

9
00:33.780 --> 00:36.990
you can pause the video here and try to work it out yourself,

10
00:37.200 --> 00:41.010
using MDN and Google search. Alternatively,

11
00:41.010 --> 00:45.690
you can follow along with me and we're going to go through the same process.

12
00:45.720 --> 00:49.200
So we're looking for a bullet list maybe.

13
00:50.190 --> 00:54.750
Um, and it's going to be in HTML. That's the language we want to write it in.

14
00:55.170 --> 00:59.190
And I'm going to use MDN as my documentation source.

15
00:59.520 --> 01:00.720
So if you hit enter,

16
01:01.230 --> 01:05.520
you can see that the first one that comes up is the ul element

17
01:05.730 --> 01:07.950
and that's exactly what we want.

18
01:08.400 --> 01:11.670
UL stands for unordered list,

19
01:11.790 --> 01:16.790
so essentially a bullet point list. Now ordered list would be something that has,

20
01:17.790 --> 01:22.320
you know, a, b, c, or 1, 2, 3. But in our case,

21
01:22.380 --> 01:26.910
this is exactly what we want. And you can see that this is a simple example

22
01:27.090 --> 01:31.950
which will render like so where the ul tag encloses

23
01:31.980 --> 01:36.980
all the parts that will be included in the bullet list and the li tag or the

24
01:38.310 --> 01:41.460
list item tag encloses each

25
01:41.520 --> 01:45.450
and every bullet point. Alternatively,

26
01:45.450 --> 01:49.080
you have a slightly more complex, more nested unordered list.

27
01:49.470 --> 01:51.570
And that looks more like this.

28
01:51.720 --> 01:54.660
So let's go ahead and add this to our code.

29
01:55.830 --> 02:00.830
So we've got this h3 that is the subtitle for the books and courses that

30
02:01.440 --> 02:02.273
we're teaching.

31
02:02.370 --> 02:07.370
So I'm going to go ahead and add a new ul, unordered list, and a new list item.

32
02:10.950 --> 02:15.950
And I'll add something like The complete iOS App development

33
02:18.170 --> 02:19.003
Bootcamp.

34
02:21.080 --> 02:25.820
And then I'll go ahead and add another one, The complete--

35
02:30.890 --> 02:34.070
And if we again hit save and check it out,

36
02:34.730 --> 02:39.730
you can see that they are there as an unordered list or as bullet points.

37
02:40.790 --> 02:41.623
All right, cool.

38
02:42.050 --> 02:46.550
So the next thing that I want to add is outside of the unordered list.

39
02:46.850 --> 02:48.800
I'm going to add another h3

40
02:48.920 --> 02:53.540
and this is going to have the subtitle of, let's say, my hobbies.

41
02:55.760 --> 03:00.460
And here, I want to have an ordered list that's 1, 2,

42
03:00.490 --> 03:03.970
3, and it's going to list some of my hobbies.

43
03:04.270 --> 03:09.270
So can you try and use MDN as well as search to figure out how to do that and

44
03:11.200 --> 03:14.470
then list your hobbies in that ordered list?

45
03:17.700 --> 03:17.940
<v 1>Right.</v>

46
03:17.940 --> 03:19.530
<v 0>All right. So let's walk through it together.</v>

47
03:20.010 --> 03:23.550
If we have a look at an unordered list, if you scroll to the bottom,

48
03:23.910 --> 03:27.120
there's usually a part where it says, see also on MDN.

49
03:27.240 --> 03:30.600
And this tells you these related HTML elements

50
03:30.900 --> 03:34.490
which are list items and the ordered list,

51
03:34.500 --> 03:39.500
the ol. So let's click on that and we can see how this works.

52
03:40.140 --> 03:43.530
This is a simple example of an ordered list, and you've got the first,

53
03:43.530 --> 03:45.510
second and third item as list items.

54
03:45.720 --> 03:49.710
So the format is exactly the same as the unordered or the bullet list,

55
03:50.010 --> 03:53.250
apart from the fact that this time replacing ul with ol.

56
03:53.310 --> 03:55.800
And similarly you can nest these lists.

57
03:56.040 --> 04:01.040
You can nest a ordered list inside an unordered list and also vice versa.

58
04:02.220 --> 04:05.850
And there's a whole bunch of modifications that you can have with your ordered

59
04:05.850 --> 04:10.290
list. For example, using Roman numerals instead of using numbers.

60
04:10.590 --> 04:13.650
And let's go ahead and put it into practice on our website.

61
04:14.100 --> 04:18.960
So I'm going to list a whole bunch of hobbies under a ordered list.

62
04:19.440 --> 04:23.760
And the first list item is going to be, let's say beer brewing,

63
04:25.380 --> 04:29.070
and the next one will be martial arts,

64
04:29.130 --> 04:29.963
<v 1>yeah?</v>

65
04:31.440 --> 04:36.180
<v 0>And the last one can be motorcycles.</v>

66
04:37.380 --> 04:38.250
There we go. Cool.

67
04:38.340 --> 04:43.340
So those are my hobbies and they're included under an ordered list inside list

68
04:43.950 --> 04:48.270
items. And if we go ahead and hit save, and then hit refresh,

69
04:48.600 --> 04:53.100
you can see that we've got our ordered list and our unordered list inside our

70
04:53.100 --> 04:57.690
homepage. All right, cool. So this lesson was all about HTML list.

71
04:57.840 --> 04:58.980
If you are interested,

72
04:59.040 --> 05:02.010
you can have a look at some of these other types of lists,

73
05:02.190 --> 05:03.330
such as the ordered list

74
05:03.330 --> 05:08.250
which starts at a particular number or the list that use Roman numerals.

75
05:08.550 --> 05:13.050
And you can mess around with that code inside your playbook or inside your

76
05:13.050 --> 05:16.560
website. In the next lesson, we're going to be covering the image element,

77
05:16.680 --> 05:20.010
and we're going to be brightening up a website with some pictures.

78
05:20.250 --> 05:23.280
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
