00:00.420 --> 00:04.410
Now, if we compare our current site against Jon Kleinbergs,

1
00:04.410 --> 00:09.410
the only major difference that you will see now is that his has a whole bunch

2
00:09.990 --> 00:13.260
of hyperlinks interspersed in the homepage

3
00:13.500 --> 00:16.980
whereas ours is completely devoid of any hyperlinks.

4
00:17.370 --> 00:20.700
If we think back to what HTML stands for,

5
00:20.790 --> 00:23.460
we've talked about the markup language part already

6
00:23.700 --> 00:27.900
but we haven't yet talked about the hypertext part of HTML.

7
00:28.230 --> 00:32.820
So hypertext is basically just a bunch of text documents that can be linked

8
00:32.820 --> 00:37.020
together using these hyperlinks. So when you click on one of them,

9
00:37.260 --> 00:39.540
it takes you to a different text document,

10
00:39.900 --> 00:44.250
and then you click on the link there and it takes you to another different text

11
00:44.250 --> 00:48.660
document. And that's where the HT part of HTML comes from.

12
00:48.960 --> 00:53.610
And in fact, if you're interested, there is even a game called the Wiki game

13
00:53.910 --> 00:54.060
where

14
00:54.060 --> 00:59.060
you have a starting Wikipedia article and a goal Wikipedia article

15
00:59.520 --> 01:04.520
and you have to click through the links on Wikipedia to try and navigate to the

16
01:05.490 --> 01:06.720
goal article.

17
01:06.960 --> 01:11.430
And it's basically an association game that's played using hyperlinks. Now,

18
01:11.430 --> 01:13.710
what are these links made of?

19
01:14.040 --> 01:17.010
If you have a look at each and every one of these links,

20
01:17.280 --> 01:20.850
if you right click on it and click inspect, you know

21
01:20.850 --> 01:25.470
that you can bring up the Google Chrome developer tools. And if we have a look,

22
01:25.530 --> 01:28.800
you can see that it's actually pointing towards a

23
01:29.070 --> 01:34.070
a-tag with a hyperlink reference to the destination that this link is going to

24
01:34.740 --> 01:39.720
take you to. And before the a tag gets closed, that's the link text

25
01:39.750 --> 01:44.130
so in this case it's the word computer science that gets underlined.

26
01:44.160 --> 01:47.640
And when you click on it, it takes you to cs.cornell.edu.

27
01:48.390 --> 01:51.720
Let's go ahead and implement this for our website.

28
01:52.200 --> 01:56.220
So there's many places where maybe you'd want to direct people away.

29
01:56.520 --> 01:59.910
So maybe I can link them to the App Brewery's website here,

30
02:00.390 --> 02:05.390
or I could show them examples of me brewing beer or me riding motorcycles.

31
02:07.260 --> 02:09.300
Let's go ahead and try that in code.

32
02:09.570 --> 02:14.570
So the first place that I want to add a link to is this part where it says the

33
02:14.880 --> 02:16.860
App Brewery. So I'm going to put an

34
02:16.890 --> 02:20.820
a tag or an anchor tag just in front and close the

35
02:20.820 --> 02:22.350
a tag just behind.

36
02:22.710 --> 02:26.010
And if you want to have a look at the structure of the anchor tag,

37
02:26.250 --> 02:30.270
then as you remember, you can always go to the MDN web docs

38
02:30.720 --> 02:35.130
and you can read all about the anchor element and all of its attributes.

39
02:35.790 --> 02:39.930
Now, the main attribute that we're going to be concerned with is the href.

40
02:40.260 --> 02:44.280
And this is a URL that the hyperlink is going to point to,

41
02:44.580 --> 02:47.790
or the destination of that hyperlink. In my case,

42
02:47.820 --> 02:51.360
the destination is going to be appbrewery.co.

43
02:52.320 --> 02:53.760
And if I just copy that,

44
02:54.360 --> 02:57.540
then I can head over here and add an

45
02:57.750 --> 03:02.750
a tag or an anchor tag just before where it says the App Brewery and this is

46
03:04.240 --> 03:07.320
what the autofill is going to write for me.

47
03:07.530 --> 03:11.940
So let's have a look at the structure in a bit more detail. As with the other

48
03:11.940 --> 03:12.840
HTML elements

49
03:12.840 --> 03:17.250
we've seen, the anchor tag has the a as the element name,

50
03:17.640 --> 03:20.940
and then the most important attribute that you're going to find yourself using

51
03:20.970 --> 03:22.170
is the href

52
03:22.560 --> 03:27.150
and this is set to equal the link destination.

53
03:27.390 --> 03:31.680
So where are you going to take your user when they click on this link?

54
03:32.130 --> 03:35.250
And the anchor tag is not a self-closing tag.

55
03:35.520 --> 03:40.520
So it has a closing tag at the end and between the open tag and the closing tag

56
03:42.060 --> 03:44.130
is our link text.

57
03:44.550 --> 03:48.750
So that's the bit of text that's going to be underlined and highlighted in blue

58
03:49.140 --> 03:52.200
so that the user knows that when they click on this word,

59
03:52.470 --> 03:56.610
this is going to take them to that link. So in our case,

60
03:56.640 --> 04:01.640
our href is going there to be this URL and between the open anchor tag and

61
04:04.770 --> 04:08.790
the closing anchor tag, we're going to put the link text,

62
04:08.820 --> 04:12.690
so the bit of text that's going to be underlined. And in my case,

63
04:12.720 --> 04:17.720
I'm just going to cut this phrase here and put it inside the anchor tag.

64
04:21.150 --> 04:26.150
So now you can see there's actually two sets of HTML elements that enclose this

65
04:26.910 --> 04:31.890
line of text. It is simultaneously going to be strong,

66
04:31.950 --> 04:33.060
i.e. bolded.

67
04:33.540 --> 04:38.540
And it's also going to act as a link to the appbrewery.co website.

68
04:39.840 --> 04:44.840
So if we hit save and let's go back over here and hit refresh,

69
04:45.180 --> 04:50.180
you can see that this has now been underlined and it's highlighted in a

70
04:50.550 --> 04:53.190
different color. Now by convention,

71
04:53.250 --> 04:58.250
the highlight is going to be blue if its a link that we've never clicked on and

72
04:58.380 --> 05:02.400
it's going to be purple if we have clicked on it in the past.

73
05:02.580 --> 05:04.950
And just to confirm, if we click on it,

74
05:05.220 --> 05:08.550
it takes us to appbrewery.co. Brilliant.

75
05:08.700 --> 05:11.700
So that is working as expected. Now,

76
05:11.730 --> 05:16.350
why don't you go ahead and add some links to your hobbies?

77
05:16.680 --> 05:18.780
So you know how they say in interviews,

78
05:18.780 --> 05:22.830
you should always prove that you've done what you say you've done.

79
05:22.920 --> 05:24.450
Go ahead and add some links

80
05:24.480 --> 05:28.260
maybe to images on the internet or to YouTube videos,

81
05:28.440 --> 05:31.890
anything that you like. Um, and it doesn't have to be in your hobbies.

82
05:31.920 --> 05:35.880
It could be in your books and teaching or education or any part of your

83
05:35.880 --> 05:40.500
website basically. So go ahead and the video and add some more links.

84
05:44.010 --> 05:47.190
So adding links to the ordered list

85
05:47.310 --> 05:51.690
or the unordered list is exactly the same as what we've done up here.

86
05:52.110 --> 05:56.310
So I'm going to go ahead and add an anchor tag to beer brewing.

87
05:56.730 --> 06:00.440
Then I'm going to hit enter to create my anchor tag.

88
06:00.830 --> 06:05.690
I'm going to put the words beer brewing in between my anchor tag so that

89
06:05.690 --> 06:07.670
that will act as the link text.

90
06:08.060 --> 06:13.060
And my href is going to be a YouTube video that I've got where I show people my

91
06:15.260 --> 06:16.093
beer brewing.

92
06:16.700 --> 06:20.960
So let's go ahead and copy that and paste it into here.

93
06:21.680 --> 06:26.680
And then I'm going to add another anchor tag here just to fill up the motorcycle

94
06:28.280 --> 06:28.660
part.

95
06:28.660 --> 06:29.493
<v 1>All right.</v>

96
06:33.850 --> 06:35.950
<v 0>All right. So now I've added two links,</v>

97
06:35.980 --> 06:40.980
one for beer brewing and one for the word motorcycles,

98
06:41.590 --> 06:43.810
both inside my ordered list.

99
06:44.050 --> 06:47.650
So if we hit save and we hit refresh then you'll see

100
06:47.650 --> 06:52.060
we've now got two links and they are blue because we've never clicked on it

101
06:52.060 --> 06:52.840
before.

102
06:52.840 --> 06:57.840
So if I hold down the command button on my keyboard or control on Windows and

103
06:58.270 --> 07:00.280
click on each of these links,

104
07:00.610 --> 07:05.610
then they'll open up in new tabs and we can have a look at my evidence that I

105
07:06.460 --> 07:10.780
have indeed done some beer brewing or motorcycling.

106
07:11.500 --> 07:14.020
Now that we've seen how to create some anchor tags

107
07:14.020 --> 07:16.600
that point to links on the internet,

108
07:17.230 --> 07:20.980
what if I wanted to create a separate page for the

109
07:20.980 --> 07:25.980
my hobbies section and I wanted to create a link that linked to my own page?

110
07:27.190 --> 07:32.190
Let's head back into Atom and inside this HTML personal site folder where we've

111
07:35.020 --> 07:36.580
got our index.html,

112
07:36.580 --> 07:40.720
so this file, I'm going to right-click and I'm going to click new file.

113
07:41.140 --> 07:44.560
And the new file is going to be called hobbies.html

114
07:45.490 --> 07:50.200
and it's going to be created inside the same folder as index.

115
07:50.200 --> 07:54.940
So you can see they're the same hierarchical level. Now for hobbies.html

116
07:54.940 --> 07:59.940
I'm first gonna add the HTML boilerplate code and the title is going to be My

117
08:00.250 --> 08:03.580
hobbies. In the body

118
08:03.610 --> 08:08.610
I'm just going to copy all of this and I'm going to hit command + X or control + X

119
08:10.120 --> 08:13.660
to cut, and then I'm going to paste it over here.

120
08:13.810 --> 08:18.810
So now if I hit save for hobbies and I go back to the index.html and I create

121
08:19.240 --> 08:24.240
a new anchor tag and it's going to have the link text of my hobbies.

122
08:28.480 --> 08:31.870
And the href is going to be the file name.

123
08:32.080 --> 08:35.770
So in this case it will be hobbies.html. Now,

124
08:35.770 --> 08:39.460
if I hit save and I go back to my website,

125
08:39.550 --> 08:44.550
hit refresh that ordered list has disappeared and is now replaced by this

126
08:44.650 --> 08:46.720
hyperlink. And if I click on it,

127
08:46.960 --> 08:51.960
it takes me to this brand new page that I've created called my hobbies.

128
08:53.350 --> 08:54.970
So now you can see how

129
08:55.140 --> 08:59.910
you can really easily start to create multiple pages of your website.

130
09:00.300 --> 09:04.410
And as long as you've got it inside the same folder

131
09:04.680 --> 09:09.540
or you can specify a path for the browser to get to it,

132
09:10.020 --> 09:15.020
then you can start linking up your homepage with all of these different

133
09:15.150 --> 09:16.350
satellite pages

134
09:16.620 --> 09:21.620
and you start to build up a website rather than just a web page. As a challenge

135
09:23.190 --> 09:28.190
I want you to create another page that is going to contain your contact details.

136
09:29.400 --> 09:30.750
So how do you get in touch?

137
09:30.780 --> 09:35.580
So say if somebody came across your personal site and they wanted to hire you or

138
09:35.580 --> 09:37.650
they wanted to message you, now

139
09:37.680 --> 09:40.830
it's probably quite cluttering to have it on the homepage.

140
09:41.040 --> 09:45.930
So we want to create another link down here that says, contact me

141
09:46.500 --> 09:50.310
and it's going to link to another page, just like my hobbies,

142
09:50.610 --> 09:53.970
but it's going to contain, maybe your address, maybe your email,

143
09:53.970 --> 09:54.990
maybe your telephone,

144
09:55.260 --> 09:59.070
whatever you're comfortable with giving to the internet. Go ahead,

145
09:59.280 --> 10:00.960
pause the video and give it a go.

146
10:05.340 --> 10:09.450
All right. So it's going to be exactly the same as what we did for my hobbies.

147
10:09.750 --> 10:13.050
So we're going to go to our HTML personal site folder,

148
10:13.050 --> 10:14.400
we're gonna right-click on it,

149
10:14.730 --> 10:19.730
we're going to create a new file and this is going to be called contact-me.

150
10:20.910 --> 10:24.240
html. And here we're going to, again,

151
10:24.240 --> 10:29.240
start with the HTML boilerplate and the title is going to be contact me. And in

152
10:30.930 --> 10:34.470
the body, we're going to have an h1 that's, uh,

153
10:34.530 --> 10:36.900
my contact details.

154
10:37.470 --> 10:42.470
And then below that, maybe a paragraph that's going to be my fictional address

155
10:46.290 --> 10:51.000
and maybe another one that's going to be some fictional number,

156
10:52.830 --> 10:56.100
telephone number to contact me with. Um,

157
10:56.190 --> 11:01.190
and then it will be myemail@gmail.com.

158
11:04.290 --> 11:07.500
OK. So that looks pretty good. Let's go ahead and hit save,

159
11:07.590 --> 11:12.590
go back to index.html and add another anchor tag where we'd link to this page

160
11:14.100 --> 11:17.790
called contact-me.html.

161
11:18.480 --> 11:23.480
And the link text will just be contact me and we're going to hit save and

162
11:25.230 --> 11:30.150
refresh. And now we can click on here to this brand new page.

163
11:31.110 --> 11:31.440
All right.

164
11:31.440 --> 11:36.270
So today's lesson was all about the anchor tag and be sure to check out the

165
11:36.270 --> 11:38.820
anchor tag reference on MDN web docs.

166
11:39.090 --> 11:42.660
And there's a whole bunch of other attributes that you can read about.

167
11:43.050 --> 11:46.830
And there's really good examples that can show you some of the other

168
11:46.830 --> 11:50.760
functionality that you can have by simply including the anchor tag.

169
11:51.180 --> 11:55.710
So that's all from me for today. Um, I'll see you on the next lesson.
