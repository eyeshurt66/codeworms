00:00.240 --> 00:04.050
Now once you're ready, go ahead and open up the Atom editor. Now,

1
00:04.110 --> 00:06.180
if you haven't yet installed Atom,

2
00:06.480 --> 00:10.380
this is a good point to go back and have a look at those videos on how to

3
00:10.380 --> 00:14.730
install Atom for Mac or for Windows because from here on out,

4
00:14.940 --> 00:19.080
we're going to be working with the Atom editor to create every single one of our

5
00:19.080 --> 00:20.670
websites. So it's really,

6
00:20.670 --> 00:24.090
really important that you have it set up with all the packages that we've

7
00:24.090 --> 00:26.760
specified in those installation videos.

8
00:27.120 --> 00:29.190
But once you've got it installed an open,

9
00:29.220 --> 00:32.460
you should be looking at a screen like this. Now,

10
00:32.460 --> 00:35.370
the first thing we're going to do is we're going to go to file and we're going

11
00:35.370 --> 00:38.760
to open a new project folder to work out of.

12
00:38.970 --> 00:43.890
So I want you to create a new folder either in your desktop or somewhere else

13
00:43.890 --> 00:46.790
that you prefer and it's going to be called Web Development.

14
00:48.950 --> 00:52.820
Go ahead and hit create, and then select that web development folder

15
00:52.910 --> 00:54.380
and go ahead and click open.

16
00:54.800 --> 00:59.300
And now you'll see your project folder show up in the sidebar over here

17
00:59.600 --> 01:03.260
and you can toggle it closed by clicking on that arrow button over there.

18
01:03.830 --> 01:06.140
So now that we've got our web development folder,

19
01:06.350 --> 01:08.840
this is where we're going to store all of our projects.

20
01:09.230 --> 01:12.890
The first project that we're gonna be creating is our personal website.

21
01:13.160 --> 01:17.090
So go ahead and right-click on the web development folder

22
01:17.390 --> 01:21.680
and we're going to create a new folder inside the web development folder,

23
01:22.070 --> 01:26.990
and we're going to call our project HTML - Personal Site.

24
01:27.710 --> 01:32.030
And now we're ready to create our very first HTML file inside this folder.

25
01:32.300 --> 01:37.280
So again, right-click on this tab and we're going to create a new file.

26
01:37.550 --> 01:39.020
Now, as you get used to Atom,

27
01:39.080 --> 01:42.830
you are going to start to want to use some of their shortcuts. So for example,

28
01:42.830 --> 01:45.230
instead of right-clicking and select a new file,

29
01:45.440 --> 01:50.440
you can also just simply select the HTML personal site and hit A in order to do

30
01:51.260 --> 01:54.800
the same thing. But in the beginning, as you're getting used to Atom,

31
01:55.040 --> 01:58.460
I'm going to be using a lot of the mouse controls so that you can see what's

32
01:58.460 --> 01:59.570
happening on the screen.

33
01:59.720 --> 02:03.530
But feel free to start incorporating the shortcuts into your workflow

34
02:03.770 --> 02:05.120
and as time goes on,

35
02:05.150 --> 02:08.300
you'll find that they make life so much quicker and so much easier.

36
02:08.870 --> 02:13.520
So now we're going to create our very first file and you can see the way that

37
02:13.520 --> 02:18.260
the files are structured is that we're creating it inside this folder called

38
02:18.260 --> 02:21.350
HTML - Personal Site and inside that folder,

39
02:21.380 --> 02:24.890
is where our web page is going to be located.

40
02:25.160 --> 02:28.250
Let's go ahead and create this homepage. And by convention,

41
02:28.280 --> 02:31.250
we're going to name it, index.html

42
02:31.610 --> 02:35.540
and that is usually the name that developers will give their homepage.

43
02:35.870 --> 02:39.260
So go ahead and hit enter in order to create that file.

44
02:39.470 --> 02:41.510
And if you open up this folder,

45
02:41.540 --> 02:45.860
you can see that's exactly where it's located and it should open up on the right

46
02:45.860 --> 02:50.600
hand or the main pane over here as well. Now in order to create any HTML website,

47
02:50.630 --> 02:55.010
there's a little bit of boilerplate code that's associated. Now,

48
02:55.010 --> 02:56.600
you're going to either write it all out,

49
02:57.050 --> 02:59.740
or because we installed the Emmet plugin,

50
02:59.890 --> 03:03.670
we can simply write HTML and then hit enter,

51
03:04.210 --> 03:08.740
and it will insert all of that boilerplate code for us. Now,

52
03:08.770 --> 03:09.970
if that didn't work for you,

53
03:09.970 --> 03:14.970
you could also hit the tab key after writing HTML or typing an exclamation Mark

54
03:16.000 --> 03:18.160
and then hitting the tab or the enter key.

55
03:18.490 --> 03:20.980
Try some of these combinations that you see on screen

56
03:21.010 --> 03:22.240
if it's not working for you.

57
03:22.870 --> 03:26.890
And you're going to come to see and appreciate all of the powers of the Atom

58
03:26.890 --> 03:29.020
plugins and how helpful they can be.

59
03:29.440 --> 03:34.440
So now we mentioned that this is a standard HTML boilerplate code.

60
03:34.960 --> 03:38.020
Now in Programming, we talk about boilerplates quite frequently,

61
03:38.140 --> 03:40.480
and it's similar to having a code template,

62
03:40.750 --> 03:43.390
something that you'll reuse for different projects.

63
03:43.540 --> 03:47.530
And it comes from the days when the printing press would make these heavy iron

64
03:47.530 --> 03:50.710
plates that would function as their printing template.

65
03:51.130 --> 03:54.610
And because they looked very similar to the small metal plate that identified

66
03:54.610 --> 03:58.090
the builder of a steam boiler they called it the boilerplate.

67
03:58.510 --> 04:00.310
That's just where this word comes from.

68
04:00.610 --> 04:02.470
But when we're talking about it in Programming,

69
04:02.650 --> 04:06.040
we usually mean a co-template that you can reuse. Now,

70
04:06.070 --> 04:09.790
even though we didn't have to do very much work in order to get all of this into

71
04:09.790 --> 04:13.930
our file, it would still be a shame to lose it, right? So in Atom,

72
04:14.290 --> 04:18.250
whenever you see a blue dot on the tab bar of your file,

73
04:18.550 --> 04:21.370
that means that there's unsaved progress.

74
04:21.400 --> 04:24.670
And in order to make it disappear and to keep your progress,

75
04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
you can simply go to file and then click on save or use whatever shortcut that

76
04:30.430 --> 04:33.910
shows up for you over here. It should be command + s on Mac,

77
04:34.150 --> 04:37.990
and it should be control + on Windows. For those of you who are interested,

78
04:38.050 --> 04:42.010
I've included a link to some of the most commonly used the Atom keyboard

79
04:42.010 --> 04:45.940
shortcuts and includes the commands for both Mac, Windows and Linux,

80
04:45.970 --> 04:47.740
for users on all three platforms.

81
04:47.950 --> 04:51.340
So go and have a look over there and start learning and using some of these

82
04:51.340 --> 04:54.340
shortcuts. And once you've saved your file on Atom

83
04:54.400 --> 04:56.290
you'll see that little blue dot disappear,

84
04:56.590 --> 04:59.920
and now you can be rest assured that all your progress has now been safely

85
04:59.920 --> 05:03.040
saved. Now there's quite a lot of stuff on the screen.

86
05:03.310 --> 05:08.310
So let's talk about this boilerplate line by line to understand what it all

87
05:08.920 --> 05:09.753
does.

88
05:09.820 --> 05:14.590
So the first line here is where we declare the document type.

89
05:14.920 --> 05:18.580
And this tells the browser when it opens up this file,

90
05:18.910 --> 05:23.290
what is the version of HTML that we're using. Now in this course,

91
05:23.350 --> 05:28.060
we're working with the latest version of HTML, which is HTML 5.

92
05:28.480 --> 05:30.790
Now in previous versions of HTML,

93
05:31.150 --> 05:35.980
this doc type was incredibly convoluted. And in fact,

94
05:36.010 --> 05:38.680
it can show you what some of them look like. So we can write

95
05:38.710 --> 05:42.520
html:4t for example,

96
05:42.610 --> 05:46.570
and then because we've installed emmet, if I hit tab, you can see

97
05:46.690 --> 05:51.370
this is what the boilerplate code for a particular HTML 4 version would look

98
05:51.370 --> 05:55.330
like. And you can see that doc type is a lot longer

99
05:55.540 --> 05:58.760
and very often programmers won't be able to remember that

100
05:58.970 --> 06:03.260
so they actually have to look it up somewhere. But since HTML 5,

101
06:03.530 --> 06:06.530
the doctype declaration became a lot simpler

102
06:06.620 --> 06:10.190
and now it's just exclamation !DOCTYPE html

103
06:10.340 --> 06:15.340
and this tells the browser to render this file as an HTML 5 document.

104
06:16.100 --> 06:20.480
And there's a few differences between how things will appear or how things will

105
06:20.480 --> 06:22.790
be structured depending on whether

106
06:22.790 --> 06:26.300
if the doctype was HTML5 or a previous version.

107
06:26.690 --> 06:28.760
So that's the doc type.

108
06:29.300 --> 06:33.590
Now we inserted all of this code using auto-complete from Emmet.

109
06:33.890 --> 06:37.520
And if you want to look at all the other things that you can do with Emmet,

110
06:37.790 --> 06:42.680
then you can go ahead and have a look at docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet.

111
06:43.040 --> 06:46.460
And here you can see what all of those abbreviations look like

112
06:46.580 --> 06:48.140
and what is the result of it.

113
06:48.390 --> 06:51.170
As you're developing into a professional web developer,

114
06:51.440 --> 06:55.640
it's a great resource to have in order to save yourself a lot of time

115
06:55.790 --> 06:58.220
when you get used to using these common shortcuts.

116
06:58.850 --> 07:02.240
Now the next line in our code, it's an HTML tag.

117
07:02.630 --> 07:06.650
And this tells the browser that everything in between the opening and closing

118
07:06.650 --> 07:11.540
tags is going to be HTML code. And what does that code consist of?

119
07:11.570 --> 07:15.230
Well, it consists of a head and a body.

120
07:15.740 --> 07:20.740
Now the head is the part of the HTML file that holds information about the

121
07:20.990 --> 07:25.460
webpage and it tells the browser how it should handle the page.

122
07:25.820 --> 07:27.050
So for example,

123
07:27.380 --> 07:31.010
we might have a title tag in here that tells the browser

124
07:31.250 --> 07:35.270
what is the title of this particular document or this particular page.

125
07:35.600 --> 07:38.780
So let's go ahead and give our website a title.

126
07:39.200 --> 07:41.420
Let's call it whatever your name is.

127
07:41.420 --> 07:45.470
So mine is Angela. Angela's personal site.

128
07:47.390 --> 07:50.780
And now if we go ahead and hit save,

129
07:50.810 --> 07:53.390
we can have a look at it inside our browser.

130
07:53.720 --> 07:57.320
Now there's a couple of ways how you can open up the website that you are coding

131
07:57.320 --> 07:59.090
up inside your browser. Now,

132
07:59.090 --> 08:04.090
one of these ways is simply going into your Finder or your Explorer and finding

133
08:04.250 --> 08:06.290
that index.html file,

134
08:06.380 --> 08:11.330
and then double clicking on it and it should bring it up inside Chrome. Now,

135
08:11.330 --> 08:15.830
the other way of opening up your website is if you right-

136
08:15.830 --> 08:18.770
click on your file inside Atom

137
08:19.310 --> 08:22.130
and you go to copy full path,

138
08:22.550 --> 08:27.550
then it copies the entire directory path to the location of your website.

139
08:27.920 --> 08:32.360
So if you just go ahead and paste it into the bar here and here with this file

140
08:32.360 --> 08:32.720
path,

141
08:32.720 --> 08:37.720
we're telling the browser how to find this file index.html on our computer.

142
08:38.630 --> 08:42.680
So first we're telling it to go into a folder called users,

143
08:43.070 --> 08:47.510
then we're telling it to go into a folder called angelayu. Then we're saying

144
08:47.510 --> 08:52.400
go to desktop. And then inside desktop, we're going to web development.

145
08:52.730 --> 08:55.770
And finally, we're going to HTML - Personal Site

146
08:56.070 --> 08:59.580
and that is where we're going to find that index.html site.

147
09:00.030 --> 09:05.030
Let's go ahead and hit enter on that file path in order to do exactly the same

148
09:05.430 --> 09:07.560
as double clicking on this file,

149
09:07.800 --> 09:12.090
which is opening up our website inside Chrome. Now,

150
09:12.090 --> 09:16.830
if Chrome is not your default browser, then when you see the icon

151
09:16.830 --> 09:18.960
it's not going to have the Chrome symbol here.

152
09:19.410 --> 09:22.500
So you can change that by going into your settings,

153
09:23.940 --> 09:28.140
then scrolling down to default browser in order to change it.

154
09:28.440 --> 09:30.360
Now at the moment,

155
09:30.540 --> 09:34.080
our website doesn't contain any content yet,

156
09:34.440 --> 09:38.100
but it does have a title, which you can see here

157
09:38.280 --> 09:42.900
and it says Angela's personal site, which is what we created over here.

158
09:43.440 --> 09:45.690
Now inside the head section,

159
09:45.870 --> 09:48.780
there's also this meta element.

160
09:49.200 --> 09:51.690
Now there's quite a few different meta elements,

161
09:52.020 --> 09:55.740
but this particular one is called character set.

162
09:55.950 --> 10:00.660
And the one that we're setting it to is UTF-8. Now,

163
10:00.660 --> 10:02.190
what does this line do?

164
10:02.520 --> 10:07.520
The meta elements give extra metadata or associated data to your HTML document.

165
10:10.320 --> 10:13.950
And in this case, we're telling the browser when it opens up this file

166
10:14.160 --> 10:16.290
that all the text inside

167
10:16.380 --> 10:21.300
our webpage is encoded using the UTF-8 encoding system.

168
10:21.570 --> 10:26.010
So this is basically a list of all the available characters that we can use

169
10:26.070 --> 10:29.850
inside our website for it to be rendered correctly. Now,

170
10:29.850 --> 10:33.780
sometimes when you open up a webpage, especially in an outdated browser

171
10:33.810 --> 10:35.280
like internet Explorer,

172
10:35.640 --> 10:39.330
or an email that you got from a Bulgarian friend,

173
10:39.690 --> 10:43.590
you might see some of the characters being jumbled up like this,

174
10:43.650 --> 10:45.780
and this is called Mojibake.

175
10:46.350 --> 10:51.350
And it's a Japanese word that stands for characters that are transformed.

176
10:52.440 --> 10:57.440
And it occurs because your browser is trying to render the characters using the

177
10:58.200 --> 11:00.900
wrong character set. So for example,

178
11:00.900 --> 11:05.190
if we have a look at this Wikipedia page for Mojibake in Japanese,

179
11:05.550 --> 11:10.550
you can see that currently my browser is set to render all the webpages as

180
11:10.920 --> 11:14.550
Unicode, which is very similar to UTF-8.

181
11:14.880 --> 11:16.920
And you can see that everything looks pretty legit.

182
11:16.980 --> 11:18.960
It all looks more or less like Japanese.

183
11:19.410 --> 11:24.410
But if I decide to change the encoding of my browser and for it to interpret all

184
11:25.320 --> 11:28.350
of the websites as something else say Arabic,

185
11:28.650 --> 11:32.070
then you can see that all of this webpage is now messed up.

186
11:32.370 --> 11:34.290
This is not a valid word

187
11:34.560 --> 11:39.560
and none of this has any meaning because it's encoded the website incorrectly.

188
11:40.110 --> 11:43.560
So there's quite a few different types of encoding

189
11:43.890 --> 11:48.030
and they are specialized for different languages because different languages

190
11:48.030 --> 11:50.310
use different symbols. For example,

191
11:50.310 --> 11:54.100
if you have a look at the Windows Greek symbol chart,

192
11:54.630 --> 11:58.560
you can see that the symbol at position 224,

193
11:58.620 --> 12:02.640
it looks like this, but if you have a look at the chart for Windows Arabic,

194
12:02.730 --> 12:07.110
then 224 actually encodes a completely different character.

195
12:07.620 --> 12:12.620
And that's why we get these messed up websites or strange looking emails when

196
12:12.810 --> 12:15.630
it's interpreted using the wrong encoding.

197
12:15.840 --> 12:20.840
Now UTF08 is the standard encoding that you should be using when working with

198
12:21.120 --> 12:22.260
HTML 5.

199
12:22.380 --> 12:26.130
And the reason for that is because it includes all of those

200
12:26.130 --> 12:28.860
international symbols. And in fact,

201
12:29.010 --> 12:33.720
every single symbol that is included in the Unicode character set.

202
12:34.050 --> 12:36.930
So if you go to unicode-table.com,

203
12:37.200 --> 12:41.580
then you can see a table of all of the Unicode characters.

204
12:42.060 --> 12:43.110
And if you scroll down,

205
12:43.110 --> 12:47.340
it's got this nice little animation that shows you as we change locations going

206
12:47.340 --> 12:48.173
from Latin,

207
12:48.360 --> 12:53.360
so most of the English speaking countries, to Greek and Coptic,

208
12:53.910 --> 12:58.290
and then going to Armenian, Hebrew, Arabic, and all of the different languages.

209
12:58.860 --> 13:03.270
The other thing about Unicode is that it also includes emojis.

210
13:03.630 --> 13:06.780
For example, if you have a look at the emoji chart,

211
13:06.990 --> 13:09.900
let's look for heart symbols for example,

212
13:10.500 --> 13:15.450
then we've got all of these different emoji characters that we can also use on

213
13:15.450 --> 13:17.700
our website that's encoded with UTF-8.

214
13:17.970 --> 13:19.500
So let's go ahead and give that a try.

215
13:19.500 --> 13:24.500
Let's find a nice looking heart smbol. We can right-click to copy it or hit

216
13:25.200 --> 13:26.790
command C or control C,

217
13:27.390 --> 13:32.220
and we can paste it to the front of our website title using control + V or command + V.

218
13:32.550 --> 13:37.550
And now if I hit save and go back to my website and hit command or control + r to

219
13:40.200 --> 13:43.140
refresh or click this refresh button here,

220
13:43.530 --> 13:46.920
then you can see our title is updated with that emoji.

221
13:47.070 --> 13:51.390
So everything that is Unicode can be encoded correctly using UTF-8

222
13:51.630 --> 13:55.800
and it's something that you should just have as your boilerplate code for any

223
13:55.800 --> 13:58.530
new website you create. This gives your website

224
13:58.530 --> 14:03.270
the maximum chance of being rendered correctly on browsers that are from

225
14:03.270 --> 14:05.370
international visitors. Now,

226
14:05.400 --> 14:09.240
if you're interested in doing a bit of background reading and learning more

227
14:09.240 --> 14:11.100
about Unicode and character sets,

228
14:11.400 --> 14:15.480
then this is a really good piece that I highly recommend by Joel Spolsky.

229
14:15.600 --> 14:17.160
It's a roughly 10 minute read,

230
14:17.580 --> 14:22.440
and it talks a lot about these character sets and how they encode different

231
14:22.440 --> 14:26.910
symbols and why you should be using something like Unicode or UTF-8 in your

232
14:26.910 --> 14:30.870
websites in order to ensure maximum compatibility. And so it's a good read,

233
14:31.140 --> 14:35.460
and I'll include a link to it in the resources for this lesson. Now,

234
14:35.460 --> 14:39.210
aside from the character set attribute for the meta element,

235
14:39.270 --> 14:44.010
there's also other attributes that you might see on different websites.

236
14:44.040 --> 14:48.390
So some of the common ones include the description or things like keywords

237
14:48.660 --> 14:52.280
about your website, who the author is as well as viewport.

238
14:52.760 --> 14:57.760
And these meta-tags tell the browser how it should render or display the

239
14:58.610 --> 14:59.420
webpage.

240
14:59.420 --> 15:04.420
And also they give information to search engines about the content of the

241
15:04.790 --> 15:06.800
website. So for example,

242
15:06.800 --> 15:10.580
if we go to the Mozilla MDN web docs website,

243
15:10.610 --> 15:13.550
the main page, developer.mozilla.org,

244
15:14.000 --> 15:18.260
and we right click and we view page source,

245
15:18.590 --> 15:23.590
then we get to see the entire HTML file that's used to render this particular

246
15:24.380 --> 15:24.980
page.

247
15:24.980 --> 15:29.450
So this is what our browser see's and does all the hard work of making it look

248
15:29.450 --> 15:32.510
nice and pretty like this for us. So here,

249
15:32.540 --> 15:35.600
if you go ahead and hit command + F or control + F on Windows,

250
15:35.840 --> 15:39.320
you can search for the description attribute.

251
15:40.520 --> 15:44.780
Now it's not this first one, but it is this third one

252
15:45.020 --> 15:46.790
and it's this exact thing.

253
15:47.060 --> 15:51.440
And the description says the Mozilla developer network MDN provides information

254
15:51.440 --> 15:55.790
about open web technologies including HTML, CSS and APIs. Now,

255
15:55.820 --> 15:59.450
if we go into Google and we searched for MDN,

256
16:00.110 --> 16:05.110
you can see that the snippet of text that it shows about the main MDN website is

257
16:08.120 --> 16:10.910
exactly the same as what we saw

258
16:10.940 --> 16:15.940
just here in the description meta-tags and this is what search engines do.

259
16:17.720 --> 16:20.150
They crawl the HTML of your website

260
16:20.540 --> 16:25.540
and look for certain meta-tags in order to know what your website is about,

261
16:26.630 --> 16:30.230
and also how to display it in their search index.

262
16:30.410 --> 16:33.770
And there's a whole bunch of different attributes for the meta element

263
16:34.040 --> 16:38.960
and you can have a read about it either on w3schools or what I recommend

264
16:38.960 --> 16:43.760
usually is the MDN web docs. So if you have a look at meta over here,

265
16:44.060 --> 16:46.760
then you can learn all about the different attributes,

266
16:46.790 --> 16:50.420
how to use them and what they're good for. In the next lesson,

267
16:50.450 --> 16:53.210
we're going to be tapping into our body section

268
16:53.300 --> 16:57.200
and we're going to be creating the content for this personal site of ours.

269
16:57.470 --> 17:00.350
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
