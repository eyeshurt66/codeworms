00:00.270 --> 00:01.950
All right. So in the last lesson,

1
00:01.980 --> 00:06.980
we looked at how to use HTML lists that were ordered as well as unordered. In

2
00:07.530 --> 00:08.040
this lesson

3
00:08.040 --> 00:13.010
I want to talk about the image element and how we can incorporate images into our

4
00:13.010 --> 00:16.520
website. So the image tag is again,

5
00:16.610 --> 00:20.390
a self closing tag, so it doesn't need to be closed.

6
00:20.660 --> 00:22.790
But for the image element,

7
00:23.060 --> 00:26.270
just providing an image tag isn't enough.

8
00:26.480 --> 00:31.480
You also need to specify the source and that's the source of the image that will

9
00:32.210 --> 00:35.480
be displayed. That can either be a URL

10
00:35.810 --> 00:37.700
so it can fetch it from the internet,

11
00:38.210 --> 00:43.210
or it can be a local image that's included in the same directory as your

12
00:44.000 --> 00:47.120
website. So we're going to look at both types.

13
00:47.690 --> 00:52.400
The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to look for an image of myself

14
00:53.570 --> 00:56.030
online and let's have a look and

15
00:56.030 --> 01:00.350
see if there's any images that are actually me. Oh, there we go.

16
01:00.500 --> 01:01.610
So I already found one.

17
01:02.060 --> 01:07.060
So this comes from my Twitter and you can also probably go to your own Twitter or

18
01:08.450 --> 01:09.920
your Facebook and you can right-

19
01:09.920 --> 01:14.630
click on the image and simply copy the image address. Now,

20
01:14.660 --> 01:18.350
if I paste it here, you can see the whole URL

21
01:18.410 --> 01:21.230
of where that image is located. And if I hit enter,

22
01:21.620 --> 01:26.150
my browser will fetch that image from that location. Now,

23
01:27.020 --> 01:30.830
if I copy this image address or image source

24
01:31.280 --> 01:35.960
and I add it to my website as a HTML element,

25
01:36.140 --> 01:41.090
so just above my h1, so just above my name here,

26
01:41.420 --> 01:43.460
I want my image to show up.

27
01:43.640 --> 01:47.180
So I'm going to use the image tag and the source

28
01:47.240 --> 01:49.100
I'm just going to paste in 

29
01:49.130 --> 01:52.970
that URL that I got from earlier on. Now,

30
01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
the next attribute here that comes up automatically is the alt or the

31
01:58.130 --> 02:01.760
alternative text. And this is a case for say,

32
02:01.760 --> 02:06.760
if a browser can't render the image then it will simply display an alternative

33
02:08.540 --> 02:12.650
text to the user to describe what that image was about.

34
02:12.830 --> 02:17.830
So I'll just put the alter text as Angela profile picture. Now,

35
02:19.760 --> 02:19.910
if

36
02:19.910 --> 02:24.860
you're interested in Search Engine Optimization and getting your website ranking

37
02:24.860 --> 02:26.120
for certain key words,

38
02:26.360 --> 02:31.010
this is something that Google looks at to try and figure out what your web page

39
02:31.010 --> 02:35.360
is about. So if you're making a webpage that's about burrito

40
02:35.360 --> 02:36.193
recipes

41
02:36.470 --> 02:41.450
and you add an alt text  that says finished burrito product

42
02:41.510 --> 02:41.720
image

43
02:41.720 --> 02:46.720
image1, then it helps Google to index and figure out that maybe your webpage

44
02:47.270 --> 02:52.040
is related when somebody is searching for burrito recipes. All right.

45
02:52.040 --> 02:55.730
So let's hit you save and let's refresh and check it out.

46
02:56.120 --> 03:00.430
And I've now incorporated my first image onto my personal website.

47
03:00.970 --> 03:05.860
So you can either look around for an image of yourself on Facebook or Twitter or

48
03:05.860 --> 03:08.530
anywhere that would host it. Alternatively,

49
03:08.590 --> 03:12.880
if you can't find any images of yourself on the web,

50
03:12.970 --> 03:14.350
which is probably a good thing,

51
03:14.770 --> 03:19.770
you can also create an account on Photobucket and upload your own picture in

52
03:19.870 --> 03:21.340
order to get a URL.

53
03:21.640 --> 03:26.640
And after you do so, you can simply click on the image and right click to copy

54
03:27.340 --> 03:32.340
the image address and paste it into your source between the quotation marks.

55
03:33.190 --> 03:35.890
It will work exactly the same. There we go.

56
03:36.250 --> 03:40.390
Angela is now a box of biscuits. Great. Now,

57
03:40.390 --> 03:44.740
when my browser looks through this file to see how it should load it up and

58
03:44.740 --> 03:48.040
display it, when it comes across this image tag

59
03:48.550 --> 03:53.550
it has to go and ping the servers of Twitter to try and obtain this image.

60
03:55.600 --> 03:58.600
And if it gets permission to download this image,

61
03:58.780 --> 04:02.680
then it  will grab that image and display it over here.

62
04:02.830 --> 04:07.830
So currently my image is hosted on Twitter servers and my browser has to

63
04:09.250 --> 04:13.870
download it from there in order to display it inside my webpage.

64
04:14.530 --> 04:18.550
Now, what if Twitter goes down? What if they die?

65
04:18.580 --> 04:22.390
What if nobody wants to send tweets anymore? Well,

66
04:22.390 --> 04:27.390
then their server's going to be shut down and my image will no longer be available

67
04:28.360 --> 04:29.193
for download.

68
04:29.530 --> 04:34.450
And you will instead end up with something that looks a little bit like this,

69
04:34.540 --> 04:36.610
and you might've come across it in the past

70
04:36.610 --> 04:38.230
when you've been loading up websites.

71
04:38.530 --> 04:43.530
It means that the image is no longer available or is no longer hosted at the

72
04:44.380 --> 04:47.380
address that's specified in the source.

73
04:47.830 --> 04:51.430
So in order to remove our reliance on Twitter,

74
04:51.910 --> 04:56.110
we can also put an image into our folder

75
04:56.200 --> 05:00.880
HTML - Personal Site and refer to it inside our source.

76
05:01.570 --> 05:03.820
So let's go ahead and do that. Now,

77
05:03.850 --> 05:07.750
if I go onto my desktop inside web development, inside the folder

78
05:07.810 --> 05:09.430
HTML - Personal Site,

79
05:09.850 --> 05:14.850
I can drag and drop or paste an image of me into this folder.

80
05:15.490 --> 05:20.490
And now my index.html and my picture called angela.png is in the same folder

81
05:23.320 --> 05:26.260
and I can refer to it inside my code.

82
05:26.680 --> 05:31.300
So instead of using a web address as the source of my image,

83
05:31.540 --> 05:36.540
I can simply refer to the file name because they are at the same level.

84
05:36.670 --> 05:41.670
So index.html and angela.png at the same hierarchical level,

85
05:42.340 --> 05:45.760
they're both inside my site. Now,

86
05:45.790 --> 05:47.680
if I had an images folder

87
05:50.080 --> 05:52.570
and I put my image into there,

88
05:52.990 --> 05:56.500
then I would have to add a path to get there.

89
05:56.860 --> 06:01.310
So it would be something like this. Both ways work,

90
06:01.400 --> 06:03.470
and you can do it either way you like.

91
06:03.860 --> 06:08.510
And now if you hit save and you go to my site,

92
06:08.840 --> 06:11.450
you'll notice this image change from square

93
06:11.510 --> 06:15.080
which is what it got from Twitter, to circular

94
06:15.140 --> 06:19.700
which is what it got from my local file. Now, in my case,

95
06:19.700 --> 06:23.060
I cropped my image to a circle using Photoshop.

96
06:23.270 --> 06:26.210
But if you wanted to create your own circular image,

97
06:26.300 --> 06:30.290
you can use a tool like crop- circle.imageonline.co.

98
06:30.650 --> 06:35.000
And here you'll be able to upload an image and crop the part of the image that

99
06:35.000 --> 06:39.590
you're interested and get it as a circle and be able to download it

100
06:39.620 --> 06:42.320
to use it in your website. And there we go.

101
06:42.650 --> 06:47.240
We've managed to brighten up our homepage by adding an image of ourselves to the

102
06:47.240 --> 06:49.580
top of it, using the image tag.

103
06:49.670 --> 06:54.670
And we've started to look at these HTML attributes and you can see that every

104
06:55.250 --> 07:00.250
single HTML element in the MDN reference also has a section on attributes.

105
07:01.280 --> 07:05.180
And we're really only touching the surface here because there's other attributes

106
07:05.180 --> 07:09.590
that you can add to the image element or most other elements that you decide to

107
07:09.590 --> 07:10.100
use.

108
07:10.100 --> 07:14.120
And we're going to be looking at these attributes as we come across them for

109
07:14.120 --> 07:17.450
different HTML elements. Now, in the next lesson,

110
07:17.510 --> 07:22.310
we're going to be looking at anchor tags and how we can start adding links into

111
07:22.310 --> 07:27.310
our website and how we can create new pages that can be linked to from our

112
07:27.800 --> 07:31.880
homepage. So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
