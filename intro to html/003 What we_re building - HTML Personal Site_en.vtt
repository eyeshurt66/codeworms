All right. So in this lesson,

1
00:02.100 --> 00:05.910
we're going to be building our very first website. Now,

2
00:05.940 --> 00:08.430
because we've only talked about HTML so far

3
00:08.670 --> 00:12.090
so how to you structure websites using HTML elements

4
00:12.180 --> 00:15.780
and we haven't yet gotten to the part where we've learned about styling using

5
00:15.780 --> 00:16.613
CSS,

6
00:16.710 --> 00:20.190
then we're kind of limited in terms of the kind of websites that we can make.

7
00:20.700 --> 00:25.200
But fear not. Our websites are going to be right up there with the internet Titans,

8
00:25.380 --> 00:28.050
but just way back in 1997.

9
00:28.320 --> 00:31.320
So do you remember what Yahoo looked like when it first launched?

10
00:31.380 --> 00:34.860
Or do you remember what Google looked like when it first came out? No?

11
00:34.860 --> 00:38.430
You don't remember? Well, there is a great website that can show you exactly that.

12
00:38.670 --> 00:41.340
And it's called the internet archive wayback machine,

13
00:41.700 --> 00:45.750
and you can find it at web.archive.org. Now in here,

14
00:45.780 --> 00:48.780
if you just enter the URL of a website that you are interested in,

15
00:49.050 --> 00:51.570
say yahoo.com,

16
00:52.200 --> 00:56.970
then it shows you what this website looks like all the way from 1996 to current

17
00:56.970 --> 00:58.650
date, which is 2017.

18
00:58.950 --> 01:03.950
Now let's have a look at what Yahoo looked like originally on the first day it

19
01:04.020 --> 01:08.490
was crawled, so 17th of October 1996.

20
01:08.790 --> 01:11.190
So let's go ahead and click on that snapshot.

21
01:11.940 --> 01:16.200
And this is exactly what it looked like. So if we close off this frame,

22
01:16.560 --> 01:17.393
you can see

23
01:17.700 --> 01:21.780
it's almost like as if you've time traveled back to 1996

24
01:21.780 --> 01:25.710
when Yahoo first launched and you were visiting this website for the first time.

25
01:26.280 --> 01:30.600
Now, as you can see, most of this is just pure HTML.

26
01:30.990 --> 01:35.730
It's a lot of structure and a lot of formatting, but it looks really ugly.

27
01:35.910 --> 01:39.030
But it's okay because it's a great place to get started with.

28
01:39.390 --> 01:43.560
This is the sort of website that we're going to be building by the end of this

29
01:43.560 --> 01:47.550
module. Now I hear you say, Oh, but this looks terrible. Surely

30
01:47.550 --> 01:50.430
nobody builds websites like this anymore. Well,

31
01:50.460 --> 01:54.750
this is an interesting anecdote that you might not know. If you have a look at

32
01:54.750 --> 01:57.630
some of the world's top computer science professors,

33
01:57.990 --> 02:01.140
and you look at their personal pages that they've built,

34
02:01.260 --> 02:04.200
they all look a little bit like this,

35
02:04.260 --> 02:08.220
not so dissimilar from the websites in 1996.

36
02:08.520 --> 02:11.400
So this is Thomas Cormen who's a serious algorithm guy,

37
02:11.610 --> 02:15.300
and this is a website of Jon Kleinberg and another huge name computer science

38
02:15.300 --> 02:17.790
professor. And of course the King himself,

39
02:17.820 --> 02:20.940
Donald Knuth has a website that looks like this.

40
02:21.180 --> 02:24.060
So if it's good enough for these computer science Titans,

41
02:24.330 --> 02:27.450
then it's probably good enough also for our very first website.

42
02:28.020 --> 02:29.310
By the end of this module,

43
02:29.310 --> 02:32.460
we're going to build a website that looks much like this,

44
02:32.520 --> 02:36.510
something that we can put up online to show what we've done, our CV,

45
02:36.750 --> 02:38.880
as well as our hobbies and things that we like to do.

46
02:38.910 --> 02:43.380
So you can use it as a personal site or somewhere to list your CV online.

47
02:43.740 --> 02:48.120
I hope you're excited because I'm super excited. And once you're ready,

48
02:48.180 --> 02:51.510
let's go ahead and create our very first website.
