00:00.390 --> 00:00.810
All right.

1
00:00.810 --> 00:05.810
So let's talk about the anatomy of an HTML tag and break it down to its

2
00:06.060 --> 00:10.500
component parts so that we can actually understand how they're structured and

3
00:10.500 --> 00:15.000
how we can use them. So we've written HTML elements like so.

4
00:15.420 --> 00:17.760
So here we have the words hello world

5
00:18.060 --> 00:23.060
and they're in closed by an opening tag and a closing tag.

6
00:23.670 --> 00:28.670
And in between those tags is the content that we want to apply that structure

7
00:28.980 --> 00:32.700
to. So if you think bank to the days of marking down the manuscript,

8
00:32.970 --> 00:37.970
it's exactly the same as putting down a squiggly line underneath certain words or

9
00:38.400 --> 00:42.480
phrases and asking the publisher to make it bolded

10
00:42.690 --> 00:46.590
to affect the structure of certain parts of the text. Now, in this case,

11
00:46.590 --> 00:49.380
the publisher just happens to be our browser.

12
00:49.680 --> 00:52.980
So these tags make requests to the browser

13
00:53.370 --> 00:58.370
asking it to structure and display our plaintext in the way that the web

14
00:58.470 --> 01:00.240
designer wanted it to be shown.

15
01:00.480 --> 01:05.480
Now the other type of tag that we just saw are tags that don't have a closing

16
01:05.790 --> 01:08.820
tag. They're expressed simply like so.

17
01:08.970 --> 01:13.970
And these are called self-closing tags and we've seen that with the break tag

18
01:14.490 --> 01:17.820
and there's a few more others that work like this also.

19
01:18.180 --> 01:23.180
Now how do we find out if something requires a closing tag or is self-closing?

20
01:23.970 --> 01:27.120
Well, this is where we head to the documentation again. So

21
01:28.140 --> 01:31.380
if we have a look at the documentation for the heading elements,

22
01:31.680 --> 01:36.680
you can see that there's this part in the table that says tag omission

23
01:37.080 --> 01:42.080
and it says that both the starting and ending tags are mandatory so that you

24
01:43.350 --> 01:48.350
can specify which portion of your text you want to apply this structure to.

25
01:50.340 --> 01:53.790
Now, if we have a look at the br or the line break element,

26
01:54.180 --> 01:56.820
you can see that under tag omission,

27
01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
it says that it must have a start tag and must not have an end tag.

28
02:02.550 --> 02:07.350
So this is how we find out how we write our tags. Now, while we're here,

29
02:07.410 --> 02:12.410
I want to introduce you to another element called the horizontal rule or the hr

30
02:13.770 --> 02:14.603
tag.

31
02:14.670 --> 02:19.650
And this will allow us to create these horizontal lines above and below our

32
02:19.650 --> 02:24.480
portion of text. So as you can see in the documentation under tag omission,

33
02:24.540 --> 02:27.750
it also says that it must not have an end tag.

34
02:27.990 --> 02:30.870
So this is also a self-closing tag.

35
02:32.190 --> 02:36.780
Let's head back over to our pen so that we can add these two horizontal rules

36
02:36.840 --> 02:40.710
above and below our text. So the first one is going to go here

37
02:43.320 --> 02:45.690
and the last one is going to go here.

38
02:46.140 --> 02:51.140
You can see that our webpage now has two horizontal lines above and below our

39
02:51.240 --> 02:53.280
main portion of text. Now,

40
02:53.310 --> 02:56.250
if we have a closer look at this website,

41
02:56.490 --> 03:01.490
you can see that their horizontal rule is a little bit thicker than ours.

42
03:02.290 --> 03:05.940
So how can we make ours look more like theirs?

43
03:06.480 --> 03:11.010
Now, this is part where I show you a neat trick. On any webpage that you open in

44
03:11.010 --> 03:11.640
Chrome

45
03:11.640 --> 03:16.640
you can simply right click on the element that you're interested in and click

46
03:16.950 --> 03:21.950
inspect in order to look at the HTML and CSS code that's being rendered in the

47
03:23.550 --> 03:28.320
background by the browser. So you can see here, they've got an hr element,

48
03:28.410 --> 03:29.370
horizontal rule,

49
03:29.820 --> 03:33.660
but they've got also all of this going on afterwards.

50
03:33.990 --> 03:36.270
What exactly is that?

51
03:36.900 --> 03:41.900
Now we know that the first part of the tag is the HTML element and it's be or hr or

52
03:45.600 --> 03:47.430
whatever it is that you want to use.

53
03:47.880 --> 03:51.300
Now the second part inside the angle bracket or

54
03:51.320 --> 03:56.320
inside our tag is new and this is called an HTML attribute and it basically

55
03:58.290 --> 04:03.290
gives more information to the browser to specify modifications to that HTML

56
04:05.430 --> 04:09.570
element. So in this case, we're saying that we want a horizontal rule,

57
04:09.810 --> 04:14.760
but we want it in size three. Now, what does size three mean

58
04:14.910 --> 04:19.350
and how do we know that we have these HTML attributes available to us?

59
04:19.800 --> 04:22.710
You've guessed it. We're going back to the documentation.

60
04:23.580 --> 04:27.000
Now I know I'm making a big deal about going to the documentation,

61
04:27.330 --> 04:31.080
but it really, really is an important skill. Understanding

62
04:31.110 --> 04:33.870
and being able to look up the documentation,

63
04:34.050 --> 04:39.050
being familiar with the structure of it and where to look in order to find out

64
04:39.150 --> 04:41.940
how to implement or do certain things.

65
04:43.140 --> 04:46.170
If we have a look at our documentation for hr,

66
04:46.440 --> 04:49.110
you can see that there's this section called attributes.

67
04:49.410 --> 04:54.410
And that's what we spoke about just now. The attribute comes after the main HTML

68
04:55.530 --> 04:59.730
element and is separated from the element by a single space.

69
05:00.120 --> 05:04.830
In this case, the horizontal rule element has actually quite a few attributes,

70
05:05.160 --> 05:06.780
including align

71
05:06.840 --> 05:11.840
so you can specify whether if you want your horizontal line to align to the left

72
05:12.180 --> 05:14.370
or align to the right or be centered,

73
05:14.520 --> 05:18.090
you can specify the color of the horizontal rule,

74
05:18.150 --> 05:22.620
you can set whether if you want the horizontal rule to have shading or not,

75
05:22.950 --> 05:27.900
and you can also set the height in pixels of that horizontal rule,

76
05:28.140 --> 05:32.640
which is what we saw earlier on over here. So in this case,

77
05:33.090 --> 05:38.090
the reason why their horizontal rule looks different ours is because ours is by

78
05:38.490 --> 05:42.600
default, only one pixel high or one pixel in size

79
05:42.930 --> 05:43.763
whereas theirs,

80
05:43.770 --> 05:48.770
if you inspect in the HTML, is three pixels in height and they've also specified

81
05:50.340 --> 05:54.180
no shade i.e. no shading to the horizontal rule.

82
05:54.630 --> 05:59.210
So if we want to make our website a seamless copy of what we see here,

83
05:59.540 --> 06:04.010
then we also have to specify those attributes. So if you remember,

84
06:04.190 --> 06:08.810
the horizontal rule is a self-closing tag. And so inside the tag,

85
06:08.840 --> 06:10.070
we're going to make a space

86
06:10.310 --> 06:13.340
and then we're going to specify the name of the attribute

87
06:13.640 --> 06:17.900
which we know from the documentation to be called the size attribute,

88
06:18.020 --> 06:20.300
and we're going to set it to equal three pixels.

89
06:20.600 --> 06:25.070
And then we're going to specify that it is no shade i.e. no shading.

90
06:25.370 --> 06:28.100
And we know all of this from the documentation.

91
06:28.610 --> 06:30.500
So now once our code updates,

92
06:30.620 --> 06:35.120
you can see that this brand new horizontal rule looks completely different from

93
06:35.120 --> 06:38.990
what it was before and we can copy this over to the top as well

94
06:39.410 --> 06:44.410
so that our horizontal rules look exactly the same as what we've got over here.

95
06:45.530 --> 06:50.150
So now we've seen HTML elements that require an opening tag

96
06:50.180 --> 06:51.800
as well as a closing tag.

97
06:52.070 --> 06:56.300
We've also seen HTML elements that have a self-closing tag.

98
06:56.390 --> 06:57.140
And finally,

99
06:57.140 --> 07:02.140
we've seen that HTML elements can also have an attribute where you can specify

100
07:02.270 --> 07:06.170
modifications to the default element. Now,

101
07:06.170 --> 07:11.170
all we need is just to add one final tag called center to our HTML file

102
07:12.080 --> 07:16.310
and we would have now faithfully copied what this website looks like.

103
07:16.610 --> 07:21.500
So you can have a look through the HTML by, remember, right-clicking and

104
07:21.500 --> 07:23.180
inspecting in Chrome.

105
07:23.450 --> 07:27.470
And you can look through to see how they've structured the rest of the document

106
07:27.470 --> 07:32.390
as well. Now, this is a good point to mention our first challenge.

107
07:33.020 --> 07:37.370
So we've got this code pen now where we've been messing around with the HTML.

108
07:37.730 --> 07:41.570
Now you can either save this anonymously or you can create a free account in

109
07:41.570 --> 07:44.900
code pen in order to be able to access this later on.

110
07:45.110 --> 07:50.110
But I want you to create a brand new pen and this pen is going to be our code

111
07:51.020 --> 07:55.610
playbook. And you get to use this document as an interactive notebook

112
07:55.640 --> 07:58.670
if you will and I want you to document here

113
07:58.820 --> 08:03.140
all the new things that you've learned as we progress through the course.

114
08:03.860 --> 08:08.780
For example, in this and the last lesson, we learned about the h1 tag.

115
08:08.870 --> 08:10.490
So in our code play book,

116
08:10.550 --> 08:14.000
the first thing that's going to go in is your h1 tag

117
08:14.330 --> 08:19.330
and you can say that this is a level one heading created using the h1 tag 

118
08:23.810 --> 08:28.810
and you go ahead and close it off. And you can look through the documentation to

119
08:28.970 --> 08:31.610
perhaps copy some of these code snippets over,

120
08:31.850 --> 08:35.030
but make sure that whenever you're copying pasting code,

121
08:35.300 --> 08:38.000
that you understand what the code does.

122
08:38.300 --> 08:41.840
There is nothing worse than copying and pasting code that breaks your website

123
08:42.080 --> 08:44.990
because you didn't understand what you've put in there.

124
08:45.470 --> 08:49.730
So we can go ahead and then modify each of these so that when we're creating our

125
08:49.730 --> 08:54.290
own websites and we want to come back to our playbook and have it as a point of

126
08:54.290 --> 08:57.870
reference, then we'll be able to see easily at a glance,

127
08:58.140 --> 09:01.890
all of the elements that we've used and that we've learned about before.

128
09:02.040 --> 09:07.040
So my challenge to you is to create your very own code playbook and to start

129
09:08.340 --> 09:12.600
keeping notes on all the things that you're learning in this course. Now,

130
09:12.600 --> 09:17.160
sometimes with certain elements, for example, the line break, you won't

131
09:17.160 --> 09:21.180
be able to put any text inside the line break in the same way that we've

132
09:21.180 --> 09:23.400
done so for the h1 tag.

133
09:23.820 --> 09:28.050
This is a point where you can use a comment instead in your HTML file.

134
09:28.590 --> 09:30.660
Comments are portions of text

135
09:30.750 --> 09:35.220
which are marked out to be ignored by the browser.

136
09:36.150 --> 09:40.740
And they're usually places where you write notes to yourself or notes to fellow

137
09:40.740 --> 09:44.700
programmers who might be looking at your code. So in HTML,

138
09:44.700 --> 09:47.820
we create a comment by using the angle bracket,

139
09:48.270 --> 09:50.970
a exclamation Mark, two dashes,

140
09:51.780 --> 09:53.940
and then to close off the comment,

141
09:54.030 --> 09:57.660
we use another two dashes and a closing angle bracket.

142
09:58.260 --> 10:01.620
And everything in between here is a comment.

143
10:02.130 --> 10:06.600
You can see that usually it gets highlighted in a different color and none of it

144
10:06.600 --> 10:09.210
gets interpreted into the webpage.

145
10:09.540 --> 10:14.040
So this is where you can put sections for your notes. For example,

146
10:14.040 --> 10:15.690
self-closing tags.

147
10:15.720 --> 10:20.400
You can make it into several paragraphs just by putting the closing tag at the

148
10:20.400 --> 10:21.180
bottom.

149
10:21.180 --> 10:25.830
And you can write notes on the elements as we come across them and keep this for

150
10:25.830 --> 10:30.270
your own reference. By the time when you're ready to create your own websites,

151
10:30.540 --> 10:35.130
it will be a goldmine of a resource to jog your memory on all of the lessons

152
10:35.130 --> 10:37.680
that you've learned. So in the next lesson,

153
10:37.710 --> 10:42.480
we're going to be building our very first website and it's going to be really,

154
10:42.480 --> 10:46.200
really awesome because we're going to be using a real text editor and we're

155
10:46.200 --> 10:49.260
going to be putting that website live onto the internet.

156
10:49.590 --> 10:52.320
So there's all of that and more yet to come.

157
10:52.590 --> 10:54.750
So I we'll see you on the next lesson.
