00:00.630 --> 00:05.610
All right. So now let's tackle what exactly is HTML and how do we

1
00:05.630 --> 00:07.700
use it to structure our websites.

2
00:08.300 --> 00:12.380
So no matter what you use as your browser, it could be Chrome,

3
00:12.620 --> 00:15.350
it could be Safari or Firefox.

4
00:15.710 --> 00:18.170
They all have a single purpose

5
00:18.410 --> 00:22.610
and that's to interpret your files, such as your HTML files,

6
00:22.880 --> 00:27.080
CSS files, your JavaScript files into a website that should be displayed.

7
00:27.530 --> 00:30.290
For example, we've got a little bit of HTML code here

8
00:30.620 --> 00:35.570
that says that our website should have a title called hello and in the body,

9
00:35.780 --> 00:38.480
there should be a heading that says hello world.

10
00:38.990 --> 00:42.560
So if we pass that code into our browser,

11
00:42.950 --> 00:47.570
it will open it up and display it like so with the title of the website

12
00:47.600 --> 00:51.320
usually on the top bar and that H1 or that big heading

13
00:51.500 --> 00:56.270
showing up in the body of our website. So before we dive deep into this,

14
00:56.270 --> 01:01.270
it's really important to remember that HTML is the foundation of all websites.

15
01:02.630 --> 01:03.890
So for example,

16
01:03.920 --> 01:08.870
you won't see websites that are created using just a CSS file or just a

17
01:08.870 --> 01:13.820
JavaScript file, but you can create websites using just an HTML file.

18
01:14.270 --> 01:18.800
Now it might not look great. It will probably look like came from the nineties,

19
01:18.980 --> 01:19.850
but it does enable

20
01:20.120 --> 01:25.120
your website to display texts or various elements such as images or forms or

21
01:25.280 --> 01:29.090
tables, depending on how you code up the HTML file.

22
01:29.330 --> 01:33.410
So HTML stands for hypertext markup language

23
01:33.740 --> 01:37.070
and the really important part here is the word markup

24
01:37.220 --> 01:39.920
because there's many markup languages. For example,

25
01:40.010 --> 01:44.330
you might have heard of things such as XML, extensible markup language,

26
01:44.450 --> 01:47.390
or GML, generalized markup language.

27
01:47.690 --> 01:52.610
And all of these languages share a common history. They're based off the markup

28
01:52.670 --> 01:57.670
that used to be put into manuscripts where editors would mock up the manuscript

29
01:58.190 --> 02:03.190
and either specify changes to the author or specify structure and layout to the

30
02:03.350 --> 02:04.850
publishers. So for example,

31
02:04.850 --> 02:09.800
you might have the squiggly line that shows the publishers that this part should

32
02:09.800 --> 02:11.300
be printed in bold,

33
02:11.720 --> 02:16.720
or this part should be printed in italics. And HTML works in much the same way.

34
02:18.050 --> 02:23.050
You can specify the layout and structure of your website by using HTML tags.

35
02:25.280 --> 02:30.170
So if you had it over to your browser and go to a website called codepen.io,

36
02:30.560 --> 02:34.790
then we can have a look and have a play around with real-life HTML.

37
02:35.600 --> 02:37.130
So you don't have to sign up,

38
02:37.400 --> 02:41.390
just head over to codepen.io and then hit create new pen.

39
02:42.770 --> 02:46.340
And then we're going to change the view to a format like this.

40
02:46.490 --> 02:48.890
So this is the live version of our website,

41
02:49.430 --> 02:51.860
and these are the places where we're going to put our code.

42
02:52.040 --> 02:55.790
So as you can see codepen lets you put in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,

43
02:56.060 --> 03:00.160
which will together get interpreted and get shown on the left as your website.

44
03:00.490 --> 03:03.340
Now, as we're only working with HTML at the moment,

45
03:03.520 --> 03:07.660
I'm going to minimize the CSS and JavaScript sections

46
03:07.990 --> 03:11.740
and I'm just going to work from the HTML, um, section.

47
03:12.490 --> 03:15.100
Now we're going to need some text to work with

48
03:15.340 --> 03:18.520
or to have something which we can give structure to.

49
03:19.240 --> 03:24.070
If you head over to gutenberg.org/ebook/1661,

50
03:24.430 --> 03:28.480
you get taken to the adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle.

51
03:28.720 --> 03:33.070
So one of my favorite books of all time. If you have a look down here,

52
03:33.070 --> 03:36.580
you can see that you can view the book as plain text,

53
03:37.090 --> 03:40.360
or you can read this book online as HTML.

54
03:41.620 --> 03:44.410
So this is what the plain text looks like.

55
03:44.710 --> 03:47.170
It has all of the texts in the book,

56
03:47.410 --> 03:49.930
but absolutely no structure.

57
03:50.470 --> 03:52.900
But when we have a look at the HTML file,

58
03:53.080 --> 03:58.080
you can see that it has laid out the book where a structure that is more human

59
03:58.690 --> 04:02.650
readable, and this is what we're going to replicate using HTML.

60
04:03.070 --> 04:06.430
So if you go ahead and just copy this part,

61
04:06.880 --> 04:09.430
the adventures of Sherlock Holmes by sir Arthur Conan Doyle,

62
04:09.640 --> 04:13.450
and you copy it and place it into your pen.

63
04:13.480 --> 04:16.930
So in the HTML section here. Now,

64
04:17.050 --> 04:21.550
you can see that all of this text gets put onto the screen with absolutely no

65
04:21.550 --> 04:25.900
structure. And in order for this to start looking like this,

66
04:26.170 --> 04:28.570
we're going to start adding a little bit of HTML.

67
04:28.900 --> 04:33.880
So the first thing we can see is that this is the largest heading on the page.

68
04:34.360 --> 04:39.360
So we can make our website look like that also by adding an h1 tag into our

69
04:41.560 --> 04:45.970
HTML. So the tag starts with angular brackets and end with angular brackets

70
04:46.000 --> 04:50.980
and in the middle is the type of element or the type of tag you want to use.

71
04:51.610 --> 04:51.940
Now,

72
04:51.940 --> 04:56.860
it's really important that when you open tags that you also close them because

73
04:56.890 --> 05:01.150
as you can see here, I've got an open tag but I have yet to close it

74
05:01.450 --> 05:06.450
and it thinks that the entire contents of my page should be made into the

75
05:07.480 --> 05:10.360
largest heading possible. And that's not what I want.

76
05:10.390 --> 05:14.500
I only wanted for this section, the adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

77
05:15.010 --> 05:18.220
So in order to close the tag, it's the same angle bracket

78
05:18.460 --> 05:21.580
but then I have to use a forward slash and then write h1.

79
05:22.660 --> 05:27.660
So now only this part is an h1 or a large heading.

80
05:29.140 --> 05:31.120
Now, if we have a look at the other parts,

81
05:31.180 --> 05:36.160
I would say that this word by is a little bit smaller than the author name.

82
05:36.430 --> 05:41.140
So let's structure this as a heading also, but let's make it a subtitle.

83
05:41.140 --> 05:45.100
So let's make it a slightly smaller heading. And to do that,

84
05:45.130 --> 05:48.970
we can simply wrap this text around an h2 tag.

85
05:49.300 --> 05:53.110
And now we have Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as a heading,

86
05:53.380 --> 05:57.620
but in a smaller size and shown with less important than the big title.

87
05:57.800 --> 06:01.160
So no,w finally, we have this word by,

88
06:01.520 --> 06:04.760
and I reckon that's one size smaller than this heading.

89
06:05.090 --> 06:09.260
So let's go ahead and wrap this inside an h3.

90
06:10.610 --> 06:12.260
I hope you're starting to get the gist.

91
06:12.620 --> 06:16.820
The heading tags get smaller as the number goes up.

92
06:17.300 --> 06:20.870
So for example, if I change this to an h4,

93
06:21.050 --> 06:24.860
it gets even smaller, h5, smaller still,

94
06:25.400 --> 06:28.100
and all the way until h6

95
06:28.370 --> 06:32.900
which is the smallest font size for the heading element. Now,

96
06:32.900 --> 06:35.150
if you keep going to h7,

97
06:35.480 --> 06:38.870
you'll notice that it doesn't do anything anymore.

98
06:39.080 --> 06:42.080
It doesn't change the heading size.

99
06:42.680 --> 06:47.330
And that's because the heading elements only go from h1 to h6.

100
06:47.960 --> 06:50.810
Now, how do I know that, I hear you ask?

101
06:51.050 --> 06:55.670
So this is a good point in the course to introduce documentation.

102
06:56.030 --> 07:01.030
And the reason why I'm talking about it so early on is because of how important

103
07:01.070 --> 07:04.310
it is to your journey as a web developer.

104
07:04.700 --> 07:08.840
So one of the key skills in becoming a great web developer, or in fact,

105
07:08.960 --> 07:13.960
any sort of programmer is getting good at finding out how you can help yourself.

106
07:14.600 --> 07:17.660
And a lot of that involves getting good at Googling.

107
07:17.900 --> 07:21.770
How do you find the specific piece of information that's going to help you

108
07:21.770 --> 07:26.150
achieve what it is that you want or help you understand what it is that you want

109
07:26.150 --> 07:28.070
to know? So in this case,

110
07:28.280 --> 07:31.940
we're talking about headings and we are using HTML,

111
07:32.480 --> 07:37.190
and I'm going to add in the name of the documentation that I prefer to use,

112
07:37.190 --> 07:41.210
which is MDN and it stands for the Mozilla developer network.

113
07:41.480 --> 07:46.010
So the same people who made Firefox, for example. So if I go ahead and hit

114
07:46.100 --> 07:48.770
enter, you see a whole bunch of results come up.

115
07:49.100 --> 07:52.970
And the most relevant for us is the h1 to h6

116
07:53.210 --> 07:55.880
and it talks about headings. So if we click on that,

117
07:56.000 --> 07:59.960
you can learn more about the heading elements used in HTML

118
08:00.020 --> 08:04.550
and they even have example code snippets that show you what it would look like

119
08:04.610 --> 08:09.530
rendered in a browser. Now there's a couple of sources for documentation.

120
08:09.860 --> 08:14.260
One is of course MDN, another one is called w3schools.

121
08:14.830 --> 08:19.390
So let's see if we tried w3 schools with HTML and we're talking about

122
08:19.390 --> 08:23.420
headings, right? Let's see what we get here. So HTML

123
08:23.470 --> 08:27.070
headings is the first result that comes up. And similarly,

124
08:27.070 --> 08:30.340
you've got the code examples, you've got the results,

125
08:30.640 --> 08:34.240
and you've got a little bit of notes that tell you how you should be using your

126
08:34.240 --> 08:35.073
headings.

127
08:35.230 --> 08:39.850
Both of these places have a lot of really useful usage notes,

128
08:40.120 --> 08:43.660
and it's worth reading through when you're first coming across a particular

129
08:43.660 --> 08:44.440
element.

130
08:44.440 --> 08:48.880
That way you'll have a good foundation of knowledge when you start to build and

131
08:48.880 --> 08:51.850
create your own websites. So I want to show you one

132
08:51.880 --> 08:56.010
last resource that I quite like using, which is called devdocs.io,

133
08:56.310 --> 09:01.080
and this is basically a website that puts together a lot of the useful documentation

134
09:01.290 --> 09:03.900
in a structure that I find to be quite handy.

135
09:04.260 --> 09:08.460
So if we have a look inside the HTML 5 tab,

136
09:08.880 --> 09:13.680
and we go into the elements, we can see that there's a total of 135 elements.

137
09:13.980 --> 09:18.420
And if you scroll down, you can see that we've got h1 through to h6.

138
09:18.450 --> 09:20.880
And if you click on any of these then it brings up

139
09:20.940 --> 09:22.860
actually the MDN documentation

140
09:22.890 --> 09:26.070
so you can see that it's similar to what we saw on MDN,

141
09:26.310 --> 09:30.480
but it's just structured in a very simple way, and it's very easy to follow.

142
09:30.600 --> 09:33.120
So that's definitely a website that's worth bookmarking.

143
09:33.510 --> 09:35.910
So if we head back over to our HTML file,

144
09:36.030 --> 09:38.730
we're going to change that back to an h3

145
09:38.760 --> 09:43.760
which is an HTML tag that actually exists as opposed to something like h

146
09:43.860 --> 09:44.520
9.

147
09:44.520 --> 09:48.780
So the next thing that we need to do in order to better replicate this website

148
09:48.900 --> 09:53.900
is to add some space between these lines. Now in a word processor

149
09:54.090 --> 09:56.040
such as a Word or Google docs,

150
09:56.070 --> 10:00.120
you'll be able to simply just hit enter a few times or hit return a few times

151
10:00.360 --> 10:05.070
and get that spacing show up. Now, unfortunately, in HTML,

152
10:05.070 --> 10:07.050
it doesn't quite work like that.

153
10:07.290 --> 10:11.430
It's a little bit more complicated. In order to create that spacing,

154
10:11.520 --> 10:16.520
we actually have to use an HTML element called a line break and it's written

155
10:16.890 --> 10:17.723
like so.

156
10:17.910 --> 10:22.910
And the interesting thing about this HTML element is that it doesn't require

157
10:23.520 --> 10:25.950
both an open and a close tag.

158
10:26.250 --> 10:29.340
So when we had the h1 through the h6 tags,

159
10:29.520 --> 10:33.990
you can see that we started out by marking the text with an h1

160
10:34.050 --> 10:36.780
and then we closed it off with a closing tag.

161
10:36.960 --> 10:40.260
But the line break element works all by itself

162
10:40.290 --> 10:42.510
and you can even put it inside, like

163
10:42.510 --> 10:46.620
so, to make this part go onto a new line. Now,

164
10:46.620 --> 10:51.480
this is a good time point to review the anatomy of HTML tags.
