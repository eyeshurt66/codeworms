00:00.630 --> 00:07.170
So in the last lesson, we looked at how we're able to change the background color of the body of our

1
00:07.170 --> 00:15.390
web page by simply injecting CSS code in the same line as our body HTML element.

2
00:16.080 --> 00:23.280
Now in this lesson, we're going to look at how we can implement CSS code across the entire web page

3
00:23.460 --> 00:30.820
so we won't have to copy and paste the style attribute each time we want to change a particular element.

4
00:32.220 --> 00:39.540
So in order to do this, we're going to go into the head section of our HTML page and just below the

5
00:39.540 --> 00:40.230
title

6
00:40.560 --> 00:46.260
I'm going to add a style tag and I'm going to close it off as well.

7
00:47.640 --> 00:54.660
Now, in between the style tag, I'm going to select the HTML element that I want to effect.

8
00:55.020 --> 00:58.620
So let's first try this with our body element.

9
00:59.220 --> 01:05.940
So in order to select an HTML tag, all you have to do is specify the name of the element you want to

10
01:05.940 --> 01:08.760
change, which in this case is the body,

11
01:09.120 --> 01:16.040
and then you're going to create a set of curly braces inside which you're going to write your CSS

12
01:16.050 --> 01:20.700
code that will affect the style of the body element.

13
01:20.970 --> 01:24.180
So let's hit, enter and give ourselves a bit more space.

14
01:24.580 --> 01:29.790
And let's also indent this so that it's nested inside our style tag.

15
01:30.030 --> 01:38.790
So here I can copy this line of code straight in like so.

16
01:39.600 --> 01:45.870
So the essential elements of any CSS code that you're going to write is going to be something that

17
01:45.870 --> 01:47.430
you want to affect,

18
01:47.760 --> 01:55.080
so in this case, it's the body of the page that we want to change and then it's what you want to change

19
01:55.080 --> 01:55.770
about it,

20
01:55.800 --> 02:00.240
so in this case, it's the background color property that we want to effect.

21
02:00.690 --> 02:06.540
And finally, what is the value that you're going to change it to, which in this case is that nice color

22
02:06.540 --> 02:07.620
from a color palette.

23
02:08.220 --> 02:12.860
So I want to go ahead and just change this to a more obvious color.

24
02:12.870 --> 02:18.120
So back to that pretty ugly, blue looking color that we had before.

25
02:18.510 --> 02:27.390
And I'm going to delete our inline CSS here and make it go back to just a simple body tag just so that

26
02:27.390 --> 02:31.050
we can confirm that our code is in fact working.

27
02:31.620 --> 02:39.210
So now if we hit save and we go back to our website and we hit refresh, you can see that that change

28
02:39.210 --> 02:40.080
has worked.

29
02:40.320 --> 02:45.150
So we know that our CSS code is functional and it is working. Now

30
02:45.150 --> 02:51.330
sometimes when you're linking up access with your HTML file, you might have forgotten a closing tag

31
02:51.360 --> 02:53.880
or you might have put it into the wrong place.

32
02:53.880 --> 02:58.200
For example, you accidentally had it inside the body instead of the head section.

33
02:58.530 --> 03:04.320
And there's all sorts of reasons why your CSS and your HTML might not be linked together.

34
03:04.320 --> 03:10.680
So it's always a good idea just to change something really, really dramatic so that you can just confirm

35
03:10.920 --> 03:19.200
that the entire style tag is working and it's affecting the appearance of your webpage.

36
03:20.640 --> 03:26.070
So now let's change this back to that prettier color that we had,

37
03:26.610 --> 03:29.910
and let's check to make sure that it's working.

38
03:30.330 --> 03:33.690
And the next thing that we're going to change is what we mentioned before.

39
03:33.690 --> 03:40.620
We want to change the style of something that occurs repeatedly in our code, which is the horizontal

40
03:40.620 --> 03:41.040
rule.

41
03:41.520 --> 03:48.960
Now, instead of having to write the style attribute inside each and every single one of these tags,

42
03:49.410 --> 03:57.090
what I can do is I can simply select it here by saying, Let's change the style of all the horizontal

43
03:57.090 --> 04:01.080
rules and the property of the horizontal rule that I want

44
04:01.080 --> 04:04.680
to change is also it's background color.

45
04:05.220 --> 04:11.760
I don't like this greyish thing that we've got here, and I wanted it to just be pure white.

46
04:12.120 --> 04:21.660
So I want it's background color to be simply just white, a CSS color that we can have access to just

47
04:21.660 --> 04:23.490
by writing the keyword white.

48
04:24.750 --> 04:25.110
So,

49
04:26.230 --> 04:33.250
if we hit save and we head over to our website, you'll notice that nothing changes when you refresh

50
04:33.250 --> 04:33.430
it.

51
04:34.030 --> 04:36.880
It hasn't changed in its appearance at all.

52
04:37.240 --> 04:39.580
So why is that?

53
04:40.730 --> 04:49.670
Well, it's really, really important to realize that no website is completely unstyled.

54
04:49.820 --> 04:50.840
So what does that mean?

55
04:51.230 --> 04:56.480
Even before we've added any CSS code to our index.html,

56
04:56.960 --> 05:02.420
there is already some default CSS being applied by your browser.

57
05:03.290 --> 05:10.160
Now you can find out what the default CSS looks like by again searching for it.

58
05:10.370 --> 05:16.260
So let's search for browser default CSS and hit enter.

59
05:17.360 --> 05:23.750
And you can see that the first thing that we get is actually from w3schools, so I'm pretty agnostic

60
05:23.750 --> 05:25.560
towards which sources we use

61
05:25.580 --> 05:31.850
as long as they're useful and Google's always pretty good at picking out which is the most used

62
05:32.150 --> 05:37.190
or rather most useful links and put them at the top of your searches.

63
05:37.400 --> 05:44.150
So if we look inside w3schools, you can see that all these elements have default

64
05:44.160 --> 05:48.110
CSS values being applied by your browser.

65
05:48.350 --> 05:57.590
Now, if we hit Command F to find the horizontal rule, then you can see all the default CSS that it

66
05:57.590 --> 05:58.190
has.

67
05:58.790 --> 06:01.880
Now let me just talk you through what all of this does.

68
06:02.630 --> 06:10.490
Now, the first thing is that it sets a margin for our horizontal rule and then it sets the type or the

69
06:10.490 --> 06:14.540
style of our border to something called inset.

70
06:15.050 --> 06:18.680
And then it gives the border a width of one pixel.

71
06:19.250 --> 06:23.000
So what is this border style inset?

72
06:23.330 --> 06:28.670
Well, let's take a look at border-style CSS using MDN.

73
06:30.250 --> 06:35.600
And you can see that there's a whole bunch of different keywords that you can use

74
06:35.980 --> 06:38.230
that changes the border style.

75
06:38.380 --> 06:46.390
Now you'll also find the default one which is the inset border style, and this displays a border

76
06:46.390 --> 06:50.650
that makes the element look embedded and it,

77
06:50.920 --> 06:57.250
and if you look really closely at our border, it's kind of got that effect, right?

78
06:57.430 --> 07:00.970
Even though it's not that nice looking.

79
07:01.390 --> 07:06.400
That happens to be the default style that's specified by our browser.

80
07:06.940 --> 07:10.300
So let's change it to something that we want.

81
07:10.450 --> 07:13.900
Well, we actually don't really want a border.

82
07:14.260 --> 07:20.170
All we want is just to have a single line without a border that is white in color,

83
07:20.230 --> 07:20.620
right?

84
07:20.980 --> 07:23.620
So we can change the border style to none

85
07:24.010 --> 07:32.230
and we can override the default browser value by specifying a new value for it using CSS.

86
07:32.800 --> 07:35.140
So we're going to set border-style

87
07:36.900 --> 07:38.490
to none.

88
07:39.210 --> 07:47.700
And if we save something surprising is going to happen when you refresh your website, your horizontal

89
07:47.700 --> 07:49.560
rules have disappeared.

90
07:50.010 --> 07:51.480
Now why is that?

91
07:51.930 --> 07:59.370
Well, one of the most important concepts in learning CSS is realizing that pretty much everything

92
07:59.370 --> 08:04.200
that exists on the web page are essentially just boxes.

93
08:04.740 --> 08:07.290
And I can make those boxes appear

94
08:07.320 --> 08:14.190
by using this chrome plugin I've got, which is called Pesticide. Now in order to get hold of this Pesticide

95
08:14.190 --> 08:15.810
for Chrome extension,

96
08:16.230 --> 08:22.500
head over to the course resources and you'll see a link that takes you directly to this extension on

97
08:22.500 --> 08:23.460
the Chrome web store.

98
08:24.000 --> 08:30.900
And this is an extension that we've published and all you have to do to get it is just click add to

99
08:30.900 --> 08:33.120
Chrome, add Extension

100
08:33.390 --> 08:38.340
and then final step that you need to do is to go here in the top right corner,

101
08:38.370 --> 08:42.360
click on the three dots and then go to your chrome settings.

102
08:42.990 --> 08:46.300
And then here I want you to go into extensions,

103
08:46.680 --> 08:49.980
find the Pesticide for chrome extension

104
08:50.380 --> 08:53.870
and I want to you to go to details. Inside details

105
08:53.880 --> 08:59.250
make sure that this part "Allow access to file URLs" is turned on.

106
08:59.880 --> 09:06.420
This is going to allow you to develop your website locally and to allow you to use Pesticide on your

107
09:06.420 --> 09:07.440
local web sites.

108
09:08.550 --> 09:15.750
Now finally, if you want to pin the Pesticide extension so that it shows up up here, click on the

109
09:15.750 --> 09:18.510
extensions and then go ahead and click PIN.

110
09:19.050 --> 09:21.750
So that it shows up right here, and then you're ready to go.

111
09:22.350 --> 09:29.400
Now, back in your web site, if you click on the Pesticide button, then it will highlight all the

112
09:29.400 --> 09:31.320
boxes that we have on screen.

113
09:31.910 --> 09:35.040
Now, the horizontal rule is no exception.

114
09:35.070 --> 09:44.970
It's also just a rectangle, and that rectangle used to have a border specified by this border style,

115
09:45.240 --> 09:47.520
and that border had a width.

116
09:47.850 --> 09:53.700
So it was one pixel on the top, one pixel on the bottom, one pixel on the left and one pixel on the

117
09:53.700 --> 09:54.210
right.

118
09:54.810 --> 10:02.780
Now, by getting rid of that border, by setting border style to none, our rectangle now has no size.

119
10:02.790 --> 10:05.640
It's literally zero pixels high.

120
10:05.940 --> 10:13.290
So in order to change the situation, we need to change some of the CSS for the box to give it a

121
10:13.290 --> 10:14.070
height.

122
10:14.700 --> 10:22.140
So if you head over to devdocs.io and you search for height, the first one, the blue icon

123
10:22.140 --> 10:26.020
here shows you that this is CSS related documentation.

124
10:26.070 --> 10:33.270
And if you click on it, it takes you to this height CSS property and this specifies the height of an

125
10:33.270 --> 10:38.670
element, and you can read that as this thing changes the height of your box.

126
10:38.820 --> 10:49.290
So if we now give our horizontal rule a height, let's say 2px, and we hit save, once we hit refresh,

127
10:49.860 --> 10:53.580
our box now has an actual dimension.

128
10:54.060 --> 10:55.740
And you can see that here as well.

129
10:55.740 --> 11:02.310
You can see that that tiny box now has a little bit of height associated with it, whereas previously

130
11:02.400 --> 11:07.920
had zero pixels in height because only the border had a dimension to it.

131
11:08.490 --> 11:15.210
Now that height property isn't unique to just the horizontal rule, and this is the really interesting

132
11:15.210 --> 11:16.410
thing about CSS.

133
11:16.860 --> 11:24.420
Now, once you realize that essentially everything in your web page is just a whole bunch of boxes and

134
11:24.420 --> 11:32.190
the properties of these boxes can be affected by changing the CSS code, then you can pretty much apply

135
11:32.190 --> 11:37.260
the same rules or the same changes to any of these boxes you choose.

136
11:37.920 --> 11:46.920
So, for example, if I wanted to select my image HTML element, then I could write image and I can

137
11:46.920 --> 11:52.140
change its height too to something less extreme, maybe something like 20 pixels.

138
11:52.560 --> 12:01.110
And if I hit save and refresh, then you'll see that the box for my image has now become super tiny,

139
12:01.530 --> 12:04.920
and it is now only 20 pixels high.

140
12:05.340 --> 12:11.490
Now, some of you might have tried to change the height of the body, and you might have gotten stuck

141
12:11.490 --> 12:14.580
and wondered, why did it not work for the body?

142
12:15.270 --> 12:24.300
Well, it's down to the fact that the body has some default values that prevents our changing the height,

143
12:24.930 --> 12:31.050
and we're going to look at some of those things like display block in later lessons in this module to

144
12:31.050 --> 12:32.700
understand why that is.

145
12:33.360 --> 12:35.130
But for now, let's get rid of

146
12:35.180 --> 12:43.250
this style that we played to the image and let's hit save and let's see our website as it is. Now,

147
12:43.250 --> 12:50.540
if you go into devdocs and you go to the CSS section, then you can look at all of these subsections

148
12:50.540 --> 12:54.380
of how you can change the appearance of any element.

149
12:54.410 --> 13:01.100
So one of the things that you can change in addition to the height is actually the width of your element.

150
13:01.490 --> 13:11.390
So we can go and say the width of our horizontal rule should only ever be 100 pixels and we hit save

151
13:11.390 --> 13:12.740
and we refresh.

152
13:13.130 --> 13:15.830
Then you see that this is 100 pixels wide.

153
13:16.340 --> 13:23.360
Now, sometimes you might want the width to change depending on whether if you're viewing your website

154
13:23.360 --> 13:28.700
on a smartphone or whether if you're viewing on a browser or if somebody is viewing it, maybe on an

155
13:28.700 --> 13:29.600
iPad.

156
13:30.110 --> 13:38.900
So you might not want to specify a straight up hardcoded value, such as 100 pixels.

157
13:39.530 --> 13:49.220
You can also specify a percentage, so you can say the width should be 30% of the entire width

158
13:49.400 --> 13:50.450
of the webpage.

159
13:50.930 --> 13:56.230
Now, when you hit refresh, you can see that that line is much wider

160
13:56.540 --> 14:03.770
when our entire page is wider, and when our page gets narrower, it always remains 30% of the

161
14:03.770 --> 14:04.520
entire width.

162
14:04.610 --> 14:07.820
So that's another way that you can specify a size.

163
14:07.850 --> 14:15.440
Now, as a challenge, I want you to use this page on MDN, the border style property, and looking

164
14:15.440 --> 14:18.680
at all the different types of border styles

165
14:19.220 --> 14:28.340
I want you to be able to make this line similar to what Sean has here, which is just a few grey dots,

166
14:28.430 --> 14:32.630
maybe three or four, or maybe just 10 percent of the page.

167
14:33.380 --> 14:41.600
So pause the video and see if you can change the CSS in order to make that line look like this.

168
14:46.950 --> 14:49.140
All right, so how did that go?

169
14:49.350 --> 14:57.000
Now, in order to make our horizontal rule look similar to this, we know that we can change the border

170
14:57.000 --> 14:57.660
style.

171
14:58.200 --> 15:07.320
And one of those styles is the dotted style. And MDN very helpfully has this interactive box where

172
15:07.320 --> 15:10.560
we can change the properties of these borders.

173
15:11.520 --> 15:15.270
So we already know that we can't have a border to be set to none.

174
15:15.420 --> 15:17.310
We're going to need it to be dotted.

175
15:17.790 --> 15:21.420
But if we simply change this border style to

176
15:22.930 --> 15:25.540
dotted and hit save,

177
15:27.640 --> 15:30.070
then you can see if I zoom in

178
15:31.540 --> 15:40.330
that, yes, I have a border that's dotted around my horizontal rule, but this looks nothing like what

179
15:40.330 --> 15:41.560
he's got over here.

180
15:42.160 --> 15:44.020
So how can we change this?

181
15:44.260 --> 15:51.460
Well, if we only want to have a single border, then we have to turn our height down to zero again.

182
15:51.850 --> 15:57.560
So we have a box that's 0px high that only have a border.

183
15:57.700 --> 16:05.320
So you can either change the height to zero pixels or delete it outright, and that will also make it

184
16:05.320 --> 16:06.370
0px high.

185
16:06.820 --> 16:13.540
Now, if I refresh, you can see that we've now got a horizontal rule that's zero pixels high

186
16:13.990 --> 16:16.540
and we've got a border around it.

187
16:16.690 --> 16:24.340
So if we have a look here, the syntax section, it says that when one value for border-style is specified,

188
16:24.730 --> 16:28.390
then it applies the same style to all four sites.

189
16:28.660 --> 16:30.910
And that's pretty much what we're getting here.

190
16:31.890 --> 16:35.130
We're getting that dotted style across all four sides.

191
16:35.340 --> 16:37.770
Now we specified two values,

192
16:38.160 --> 16:44.610
then the first style is applied to the top and bottom borders, and the second to the left and right.

193
16:44.730 --> 16:49.290
When three values are specified, then the first one applies to the top,

194
16:49.770 --> 16:51.610
the second to the left and the right,

195
16:51.630 --> 16:53.250
and the third to the bottom.

196
16:53.790 --> 16:57.780
Or, you can also specify all four values of all four sides.

197
16:58.140 --> 17:07.770
So knowing this, we can actually change our border style to dotted so that gets applied to the top

198
17:08.160 --> 17:08.610
border,

199
17:08.820 --> 17:13.920
and then we can specify none for the rest of the borders.

200
17:14.070 --> 17:17.850
And if we hit save, we go back over here, we refresh,

201
17:18.210 --> 17:25.140
you see that we now only have the top border showing. Now an alternative way that you might have worked

202
17:25.140 --> 17:28.980
out is by simply changing the border top style.

203
17:29.430 --> 17:37.680
So we could say that the entire border-style is none, but the border-top style is going to be dotted.

204
17:38.310 --> 17:46.890
And if you hit save and you refresh, you can see that it's exactly the same effect because we're specifying

205
17:46.890 --> 17:55.140
something that is more specific than this property, we're affecting only this particular thing.

206
17:55.680 --> 18:02.880
And now our background color is redundant because our main box has no background because it has no height.

207
18:03.360 --> 18:08.550
So we can get rid of that. Now in order to make this line look more like this line,

208
18:08.850 --> 18:11.580
we have to change the size of the dots

209
18:11.910 --> 18:13.980
and also the color of the dots.

210
18:14.520 --> 18:19.980
And you can see that we can change the color by simply changing the border-color property. So we can

211
18:19.980 --> 18:24.030
change it to gray, and we can also change the border width.

212
18:24.420 --> 18:30.540
So if we say 20px, then the dots get a lot bigger, whereas 5px

213
18:31.860 --> 18:33.480
you only get very tiny dots.

214
18:34.170 --> 18:38.460
So let's go over here and add some more properties that we want to change.

215
18:39.890 --> 18:44.120
So we're going to change the border color to grey.

216
18:45.310 --> 18:46.690
And we're going to change the

217
18:47.870 --> 18:55.850
border-height... and then we're going to change the border-width to let's try 20px. And

218
18:55.850 --> 18:58.790
let's see what that now looks like.

219
18:59.030 --> 19:03.410
Ooh, that's absolutely massive and our border is still black.

220
19:03.890 --> 19:08.930
So what's going on here? Ahh... it's because we have a typo in the word grey.

221
19:09.200 --> 19:14.510
And you can see that using our packages that we've installed in Atom when it's actually a valid color

222
19:14.510 --> 19:20.000
code, it gets highlighted in a different color compared to something that doesn't exist.

223
19:21.340 --> 19:29.860
So let's change that down to maybe let's try 10px, and that is now looking pretty similar to that

224
19:29.860 --> 19:30.370
size,

225
19:30.850 --> 19:34.480
maybe smaller, still, maybe 5px.

226
19:36.790 --> 19:37.180
Yeah.

227
19:39.030 --> 19:45.180
That looks pretty similar, and we can change it down to be a lot smaller in width as well.

228
19:45.780 --> 19:52.650
So let's say maybe put the width as maybe 10% or even smaller, maybe 5%.

229
19:53.680 --> 19:55.210
Yeah, that looks pretty decent.

230
19:55.390 --> 20:04.120
So we've now more or less implemented what we see over here simply by changing the CSS style of our

231
20:04.120 --> 20:05.170
horizontal rule.

232
20:05.290 --> 20:13.300
Now there's still a bit of a problem, though, because we've changed our horizontal rule to look exactly

233
20:13.300 --> 20:14.670
the way that we want it to.

234
20:15.040 --> 20:20.320
And we, of course, want this to be consistent across our website, and we also want our background

235
20:20.320 --> 20:25.150
color to carry over to all our other web pages on our website.

236
20:25.780 --> 20:34.900
But if we look inside my hobbies or contact me, it still looks exactly the same way as it did before.

237
20:35.350 --> 20:42.370
And we're going to have to copy this entire style section over to the contact me header, as well as

238
20:42.370 --> 20:43.370
the hobbies header.

239
20:43.630 --> 20:51.010
So that's kind of a lot of work, especially if you end up with a website with, you know, 200 pages,

240
20:51.400 --> 20:58.480
then it's not a good idea to have to copy this over and change it in every single place.

241
20:58.810 --> 21:07.300
This might be easier than using inline CSS, as we did in the last lesson, but it's still quite

242
21:07.300 --> 21:08.170
repetitive.

243
21:08.500 --> 21:16.840
What we really want is to have a single location where when we change the CSS styles in that one

244
21:16.840 --> 21:23.410
location, then everything gets reflected across our website in all of the pages.

245
21:24.250 --> 21:31.030
So that is what we're going to learn about in the next lesson where we look into how we can create external

246
21:31.030 --> 21:32.870
CSS for our website.

247
21:32.920 --> 21:36.370
So stay tuned and I will see you in the next lesson.
