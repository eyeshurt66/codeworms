00:00.650 --> 00:07.700
Now, even in its current state, a Web site already compares pretty favourably with our computer science

1
00:07.700 --> 00:09.050
professor's website.

2
00:09.320 --> 00:15.080
So we're definitely doing something right here. But we can make it even better. If you take a look at

3
00:15.080 --> 00:18.950
the personal website of Sean Halpin, who's a web designer,

4
00:19.460 --> 00:23.750
this is one of the most beautiful personal web sites I've ever come across.

5
00:23.810 --> 00:29.030
It's incredibly simple, but it's also really beautiful and really well-designed.

6
00:29.690 --> 00:34.020
So this is going to be our inspiration for this CSS module.

7
00:34.430 --> 00:40.610
And I'm going to show you how by using the powers of CSS and everything that you're going to learn

8
00:40.610 --> 00:47.480
in this module, we're going to elevate the design of our personal site to look something like this

9
00:47.810 --> 00:50.240
and bring it right into the 21st century.

10
00:50.840 --> 00:58.190
So the first thing that would already make our website look a little bit nicer is changing this pretty

11
00:58.190 --> 01:02.630
bland white background to a colored background.

12
01:02.900 --> 01:09.980
So if you head of us your code file and open up index.html, we can inject a little bit of access

13
01:10.400 --> 01:14.300
right into the HTML tag that we want to effect.

14
01:14.840 --> 01:22.010
And the tag that we're interested in is the body tag because we know that most, if not all, of our

15
01:22.010 --> 01:27.260
displayed content on our website is enclosed inside this body tag.

16
01:27.650 --> 01:33.620
So if we change its background, then the entire website's background will change, too.

17
01:33.980 --> 01:44.540
So inside this body tag, we're going to tap into an attribute called style, and style takes CSS code

18
01:44.690 --> 01:46.520
inside the quotation marks.

19
01:46.730 --> 01:51.290
So the style that we want to change is the background color.

20
01:51.440 --> 01:56.900
So I'm going to write background-color and I'm going to write a colon.

21
01:57.290 --> 02:04.340
And after that colon, I'm going to specify the color that I want for the body. And let's just start

22
02:04.340 --> 02:06.140
off with a blue color.

23
02:06.740 --> 02:11.630
And then we're going to close off this line of CSS code using a semicolon.

24
02:12.260 --> 02:18.500
Now, if at this point you find that Atom is highlighting your code in a slightly different color scheme

25
02:18.710 --> 02:19.340
to mine,

26
02:19.640 --> 02:26.090
so for example, the part which says background color blue, instead of the green text I've got you've

27
02:26.090 --> 02:28.370
got white and yellow like this,

28
02:28.760 --> 02:29.620
don't worry about it.

29
02:29.690 --> 02:34.490
That's just something specific to your computer, and it doesn't mean that you've done anything wrong.

30
02:34.850 --> 02:42.260
Just make sure that you've got the semicolon that closes off that background color blue, and then you've

31
02:42.260 --> 02:45.740
got the double quotes around that entire style.

32
02:46.160 --> 02:49.640
And once you've checked those things, then you can continue on.

33
02:50.960 --> 03:00.320
And now if I hit save and if I go back to my browser, then if you hit refresh, you'll see our CSS code

34
03:00.320 --> 03:05.630
being implemented, changing the entire background of our web page.

35
03:06.410 --> 03:11.690
Now, if the background color is not changing for you, make sure that you're actually looking at the

36
03:11.690 --> 03:15.170
copy of the website that you're working on and not the GitHub version.

37
03:15.650 --> 03:17.870
This is where our development is going to happen.

38
03:17.900 --> 03:24.320
So if you don't have it up, remember you can simply right click and go to copy full path and paste it

39
03:24.320 --> 03:28.100
in here in order to get to that website under development.

40
03:28.130 --> 03:33.800
Now the question you might have at this stage beside the question of "how did we manage to get our website

41
03:33.800 --> 03:35.600
looking even uglier than before?"

42
03:36.230 --> 03:37.820
Just bear with me on that.

43
03:37.970 --> 03:44.900
But the question that most students have is, well, how did you know to use background-color and how

44
03:44.900 --> 03:48.380
did you know that blue as a color would work?

45
03:48.500 --> 03:50.870
Let's see how we can find out how to do this.

46
03:50.960 --> 04:02.570
So if I head over to Google and we search for change background color using CSS and we're going to tag

47
04:02.570 --> 04:08.330
on MDN at the end because that's our preferred documentation, and you can see that the first link

48
04:08.330 --> 04:14.610
that shows up already takes us to the documentation on the background color.

49
04:14.900 --> 04:21.680
And this page explains that the background color is a CSS property, which sets the background color

50
04:21.680 --> 04:23.450
of a particular element.

51
04:24.110 --> 04:34.430
So we've used this particular line to change the background color of our body HTML element to blue.

52
04:34.550 --> 04:43.370
Now, as it shows, we can also do this using hex values or hexadecimal values. So we can replace this

53
04:43.370 --> 04:51.920
really ugly looking blue with something that is custom. And a really good tool for finding beautiful

54
04:51.920 --> 04:57.080
colors and beautiful color palettes is a website called colorhunt.co.

55
04:57.800 --> 05:00.130
And here you've got professional designers

56
05:00.400 --> 05:07.900
who've curated some of their favorite color palettes, and they provided the Hex codes to implement

57
05:07.900 --> 05:12.580
them in your own designs. So you can search by hot or popular.

58
05:13.060 --> 05:17.950
And we're going to look for a nice color palette that is going to work for our particular project.

59
05:18.250 --> 05:25.960
So I'm going to choose this one and I'm just going to go ahead and copy the hex value of this nice sort

60
05:25.960 --> 05:29.200
of light pastel green bluey color.

61
05:29.740 --> 05:34.150
And I'm going to replace the word blue with that hex value.

62
05:34.240 --> 05:40.180
And remember, whenever you're using hex values, it needs to have the pound sign, or you might see

63
05:40.180 --> 05:42.160
it as the hashtag sign in front.

64
05:42.550 --> 05:49.690
Now, as soon as we add that hex code, you'll notice that one of our plugins that we installed in the

65
05:49.690 --> 05:56.470
beginning, the one called Pigments, is highlighting that color to us to show us what it'll look like

66
05:56.770 --> 05:57.880
when it's implemented.

67
05:58.180 --> 06:00.730
But we're going to verify that on our website as well.

68
06:01.030 --> 06:06.580
So let's go ahead and hit save and go back to our website and hit refresh.

69
06:06.970 --> 06:13.240
And you can see that beautiful light green color is now showing across our web page.

70
06:13.600 --> 06:20.890
So the other question that you might have is how can I figure out which colors I can use just by specifying

71
06:20.890 --> 06:25.360
the name of it and which ones I have to use as a hex value?

72
06:25.810 --> 06:31.630
Well, again, let's head over to Google, and we're going to look for an answer to our query.

73
06:31.900 --> 06:37.330
And I know that I've been banging on about this point, but it's really, really important because as

74
06:37.330 --> 06:44.680
a fully-fledged web developer, one of the most important skills is finding and figuring out how to

75
06:44.680 --> 06:47.650
do something that is specific to your needs.

76
06:48.010 --> 06:55.150
So inevitably, at some point in your future career, you will need to build features or implement things

77
06:55.330 --> 06:56.920
that we haven't ever talked about.

78
06:57.280 --> 07:03.460
And it's important that you really start building up this skill of figuring out what are the best keywords

79
07:03.460 --> 07:04.150
to search for,

80
07:04.420 --> 07:06.270
how do I structure my searches,

81
07:06.610 --> 07:11.170
which sources am I going to go to, be it Google, StackOverflow,

82
07:11.510 --> 07:17.590
MDN, in order to figure out how I can do this specific thing that I want to do, and that's why I want

83
07:17.590 --> 07:22.690
to show you my thought process in order to guide you on how you can start doing this for yourself as

84
07:22.690 --> 07:23.110
well.

85
07:23.500 --> 07:28.960
So whenever you come across something that you want to figure out or you want to do that isn't covered

86
07:28.960 --> 07:35.110
in the tutorials, I want you to first give it a go looking and seeing if you can figure it out for

87
07:35.110 --> 07:41.530
yourself because this is one of the most important skills that you need to learn as a developer.

88
07:42.280 --> 07:46.750
So let's go ahead and search for CSS colors.

89
07:46.750 --> 07:54.190
And if we hit enter, you'll see that Google has picked out this particular table on the MDN website

90
07:54.550 --> 07:58.570
and it has keywords and RGB hex values.

91
07:58.870 --> 08:01.420
So let's go and take a look at it in more detail.

92
08:01.630 --> 08:08.270
So this is a page that I recommend you bookmarking even because it describes the color

93
08:08.390 --> 08:11.950
CSS data type that's available to you when you use the CSS.

94
08:12.310 --> 08:19.510
And if you scroll down, there's this really useful table that shows you the colors and the keywords

95
08:19.510 --> 08:27.010
that you can use in order to implement these colors in your code without ever having to dive into the

96
08:27.010 --> 08:27.580
Hex code.

97
08:28.090 --> 08:34.450
So, for example, maybe you want the background to be this powder blue, right?

98
08:34.600 --> 08:37.540
So you can go ahead and simply copy this keyword.

99
08:37.900 --> 08:43.360
And instead of using the Hex code, we can simply use the word powder blue.

100
08:43.900 --> 08:51.280
And if we refresh our website, you can see that that color is automatically rendered because it's recognized

101
08:51.610 --> 08:53.770
as a valid CSS color.

102
08:54.010 --> 08:58.540
So this is a quick and easy way of implementing colors using CSS.

103
08:58.600 --> 09:04.090
Now there's a whole range of other ways that you can change the color using CSS, and I'll leave

104
09:04.090 --> 09:09.160
you to read through this documentation and take a look at some of the other ways or some of the other

105
09:09.160 --> 09:10.990
palettes that you can tap into.

106
09:11.410 --> 09:18.400
Now, heading back to our personal site, the next thing that I want to change is the style of these

107
09:18.400 --> 09:26.620
horizontal rules. And you might realize that there's a little bit of difficulty involved in doing this

108
09:26.620 --> 09:34.750
because as nice as it is, modifying the style of a particular HTML element by simply going into the

109
09:34.750 --> 09:42.220
tag and changing the style attribute, it's a little bit cumbersome when you want to do that to many

110
09:42.220 --> 09:43.510
repeated elements,

111
09:43.810 --> 09:50.140
for example, our horizontal rules because I have a total of about four of them, and I would have to

112
09:50.140 --> 09:56.200
write up the CSS code and copy and paste into each and every one of these tags.

113
09:56.620 --> 09:59.680
Now, if at some point I decided to change one of these

114
09:59.970 --> 10:07.530
CSS values say, you know, I actually prefer this light color over this powder blue, and I'm going

115
10:07.530 --> 10:15.480
to change it back to that particular hex code, then I would have to remember to change it in all four

116
10:15.480 --> 10:18.240
places and this is very, very error prone.

117
10:18.540 --> 10:25.020
So in the next lesson, I'm going to show you another way that you can implement CSS code that will

118
10:25.020 --> 10:28.080
apply across the entire web page.

119
10:28.530 --> 10:31.180
And it's by using internal CSS.

120
10:31.380 --> 10:33.690
You can look forward to that in the next lesson.

121
10:33.840 --> 10:34.380
See you there.
