00:01.060 --> 00:09.820
Now in the last lesson, we looked at how we can implement a CSS style and apply it to all instances of

1
00:09.820 --> 00:13.930
a particular HTML element on a single page.

2
00:13.930 --> 00:23.710
So we changed the style for our horizontal rule and by adding this internal CSS to our index.html page

3
00:24.130 --> 00:29.920
we managed to affect the style of all the horizontal rules on the same page.

4
00:29.920 --> 00:37.780
Now we're going to take it one step further and we're going to change our web site that uses internal

5
00:37.890 --> 00:47.040
CSS to external CSS and to do that we first have to create a new folder in our personal site.

6
00:47.260 --> 00:51.510
So I'm going to create a new folder that's called simply CSS.

7
00:51.790 --> 00:58.450
And inside this folder I'm going to create a new file and that file is going to be called 

8
00:58.490 --> 00:59.570
styles.css.

9
00:59.590 --> 01:06.460
So with that extension the browser will recognize it as a CSS file.

10
01:06.460 --> 01:14.320
So once you hit Enter you'll see that we have this brand new file called styles.css and we're

11
01:14.320 --> 01:22.740
going to move our code for the body and the horizontal rule over to this page.

12
01:22.870 --> 01:28.270
I'm going to hit save and we're going to remove the style tag.

13
01:28.510 --> 01:35.020
So now if I hit save and I refresh our web site you can see that all the style that we've applied is now

14
01:35.140 --> 01:40.550
gone because we've deleted it from the style tag in the header.

15
01:40.570 --> 01:46.250
Now instead what we're going to do is we're going to create a new link.

16
01:46.480 --> 01:55.630
And if you write link and you hit enter then it will autofill to say that this link has a relationship

17
01:56.020 --> 01:58.750
of something called the stylesheet.

18
01:58.750 --> 02:07.000
So when your browser reads your web page it'll go from the top to the bottom and once it hits this line

19
02:07.090 --> 02:12.540
it’ll see that "oh this is where the stylesheet for this web page resides".

20
02:12.610 --> 02:16.090
And I can go over here to fetch it.

21
02:16.090 --> 02:21.610
Now we need to change this href to point towards our styles.css.

22
02:21.730 --> 02:24.050
So the first thing we need to change is the file name.

23
02:24.070 --> 02:29.740
Our file’s not called master.css, it’s called styles.css, and the other thing that we

24
02:29.740 --> 02:33.210
have to change is this forward slash here.

25
02:33.210 --> 02:41.560
Now if an href starts off with a forward slash then it's pointing towards the root of your web site.

26
02:41.820 --> 02:45.940
It's saying that you'll find this file inside a folder called css

27
02:46.120 --> 02:52.330
inside the root of your web site. Now we're going to talk about the root a little bit later on especially

28
02:52.330 --> 02:54.650
once we start getting into Javascript.

29
02:54.910 --> 03:01.730
But for now just know that when you have a static web site that's not yet hosted anywhere,

30
03:01.900 --> 03:04.770
you can't tap into this file using the root.

31
03:04.780 --> 03:12.730
So instead we're going to say that this file resides in a folder called css and it's on the same level

32
03:13.060 --> 03:14.860
as this current file.

33
03:14.860 --> 03:23.680
So index.html is here and on the same level as it there is a folder called css inside of which there

34
03:23.680 --> 03:29.380
is a file called styles.css and that is going to be our stylesheet.

35
03:29.620 --> 03:37.840
So your browser then takes this file here then applies all of these styles to the specified elements

36
03:38.260 --> 03:41.100
inside your index.html.

37
03:41.470 --> 03:48.050
So let's hit save and let's refresh our page to make sure that it worked.

38
03:48.190 --> 03:48.990
And it has.

39
03:49.120 --> 03:53.360
So this is what we call the external CSS.

40
03:53.500 --> 04:04.510
And if we apply this style sheet to our Contact Me page as well as our Hobbies page then you'll see

41
04:04.510 --> 04:13.900
that once we go to it then you'll see that all of our styles gets applied across all three pages and

42
04:13.930 --> 04:21.810
all we have to do is just add this simple link that points towards this external stylesheet.

43
04:22.000 --> 04:29.340
And anything that we change in this single location will affect all three web pages.

44
04:29.470 --> 04:35.310
So we'll know that the style is consistent across all three pages.

45
04:35.320 --> 04:46.510
Now as a challenge I want you to select the h1 and the h3 elements on all three pages and I

46
04:46.510 --> 04:52.280
want you to change its color property to this particular color that we had on colorhunt.

47
04:52.300 --> 04:54.620
So 66BFBF.

48
04:54.820 --> 05:02.130
And by the end of it you should end up with your site looking similar to this where on all three pages

49
05:02.460 --> 05:08.800
the h1s and the h3s are colored in this new shade.

50
05:08.940 --> 05:15.660
Now remember if you don't know which CSS property to change or if the property that you're trying to

51
05:15.660 --> 05:26.790
change isn't working you can always go to Google and say ‘change text color css’ and that will help you

52
05:26.790 --> 05:29.760
figure out which property you need to change.

53
05:29.760 --> 05:33.340
So go ahead, pause the video and give it a go.

54
05:38.510 --> 05:38.870
All right.

55
05:38.870 --> 05:40.670
So how did that go?

56
05:41.000 --> 05:46.820
Well if you have any difficulty figuring out which property you need to change, because it's a property

57
05:46.820 --> 05:48.840
that we haven't used before,

58
05:48.980 --> 05:54.340
then you needed to look at some of the documentation.

59
05:54.710 --> 05:59.440
And in this case, for example changing the text using CSS,

60
05:59.540 --> 06:05.440
the first thing that it talks about is changing the text color, which is exactly what we want to do.

61
06:05.570 --> 06:12.470
And it tells you that the property that you need is something called color and you can specify the color

62
06:12.530 --> 06:19.240
just as we did before for the background color with a name or with a hex value or with an RGB value.

63
06:19.520 --> 06:24.430
So our value that we had was here, which is 66BFBF,

64
06:24.650 --> 06:29.320
we’re going to copy it and we're going to go into the styles.css,

65
06:29.390 --> 06:31.590
so our external style sheet,

66
06:31.880 --> 06:40.650
and we're going to select the element that we want to change which is the h1 as well as the h3.

67
06:41.270 --> 06:49.410
And the property that we want to change was called color and the value that we're going to give it is the

68
06:49.410 --> 06:54.790
hex code 66BFBF and we want that to be true

69
06:54.900 --> 06:56.420
in both cases.

70
06:56.460 --> 07:04.110
So now if you hit save and you go over to your site and you hit refresh then the black text becomes

71
07:04.110 --> 07:06.720
that nice green turquoise color.

72
07:07.080 --> 07:12.670
And the changes are also reflected in Hobbies and Contact Me.

73
07:14.240 --> 07:16.350
So did you get that right?

74
07:16.370 --> 07:20.270
Did you manage to figure out which property you needed to change?

75
07:20.270 --> 07:22.270
If yes then great.

76
07:22.340 --> 07:29.120
Perfect. If you want to take this challenge even further then you can style the text in more ways than

77
07:29.120 --> 07:30.490
we've specified here

78
07:30.560 --> 07:35.330
by looking through the documentation and changing anything that you want to change.

79
07:35.580 --> 07:40.380
So, for example, it's a bit odd to have the h1 the same color as the h3.

80
07:40.580 --> 07:45.260
So you could differentiate those two by making the styles of each of them different.

81
07:45.260 --> 07:52.160
Now if you've created something wonderful, wacky, or completely different from what I have then it's a

82
07:52.160 --> 07:58.070
good time to show off what you've done and head over to the Q&amp;A section and show all of your fellow

83
07:58.080 --> 08:05.600
students and post a screenshot of what your web site looks like and which CSS properties you changed

84
08:05.660 --> 08:07.080
in order to achieve it.

85
08:07.100 --> 08:13.640
Now in the next lesson we're going to look at some potential bugs that you might come across and ways

86
08:13.700 --> 08:20.950
in which you can help yourself by diagnosing what the problem is and how you can fix it yourself.

87
08:20.990 --> 08:25.010
So we're starting to learn about the important skill of debugging.

88
08:25.040 --> 08:28.640
So for all of that and more I'll see you on the next lesson.
