Now in the last lesson we looked at the simplest type of CSS selectors and that is selecting based

1
00:10.710 --> 00:13.200
on the HTML tags.

2
00:13.260 --> 00:18.900
Now in this lesson I want to show you the other things that you can use as selectors in order to make

3
00:18.900 --> 00:22.000
more specific changes to your web site. 

4
00:22.350 --> 00:26.870
So for example we have this image of a piece of bacon.

5
00:26.880 --> 00:33.930
Now what if I wanted to have another image that was a broccoli and I want to show people how much I

6
00:33.930 --> 00:35.280
dislike broccoli.

7
00:35.610 --> 00:43.170
Then I could go to emojipedia and I could search for a broccoli and I found my broccoli.

8
00:43.250 --> 00:49.320
And this is a really cool web site because it lists all of the emoji graphics from different operating

9
00:49.320 --> 00:50.070
systems.

10
00:50.070 --> 00:53.420
So this is Apple's version of a broccoli emoji.

11
00:53.640 --> 00:58.390
And this is Google's. This is Microsoft. Not sure that this really looks.

12
00:58.380 --> 01:00.450
This looks more like a tree than a broccoli.

13
01:00.450 --> 01:04.500
But feel free to go through this list and see what emoji you prefer.

14
01:04.500 --> 01:07.120
I quite like this one I think it's most realistic.

15
01:07.260 --> 01:13.650
And then just go ahead and right click and copy the image address and we're going to use that as the source

16
01:13.740 --> 01:14.810
of our image.

17
01:15.000 --> 01:16.460
And you can see up here.

18
01:16.500 --> 01:22.800
This is exactly the same way how I got the image for our bacon and I'm just going to add an alt text

19
01:22.920 --> 01:25.150
just in case the image doesn't display.

20
01:25.150 --> 01:30.260
And I'm going to say this is the broccoli-img.

21
01:30.330 --> 01:37.400
So now if I hit save and I go to my bacon fansite you can see that my broccoli now shows up.

22
01:37.530 --> 01:43.590
But the curious thing is that my broccoli also has a red background

23
01:43.590 --> 01:49.380
even though I just put it on screen, I didn’t even have time to look at the styles yet.

24
01:49.410 --> 01:50.900
So why is that.

25
01:51.420 --> 01:58.020
Well if we take a look inside style.css you can see that by targeting the image tag,

26
01:58.200 --> 02:06.150
we’re applying this red background color to every single image inside our web site.

27
02:06.330 --> 02:12.900
And that might be what you want but in most cases that's not really specific enough.

28
02:12.990 --> 02:19.770
And in my case what I'd like to do is that I want to have the bacon to have a green background color

29
02:19.800 --> 02:21.670
to say eat more bacon.

30
02:21.970 --> 02:27.110
And the broccoli to have a red background color to say broccoli is evil.

31
02:27.600 --> 02:30.090
So how can I achieve that.

32
02:30.370 --> 02:35.090
Well I can’t do that just by using tag selectors.

33
02:35.220 --> 02:42.690
So I have to go a little bit more advanced in my CSS and I have to use class selectors.

34
02:42.690 --> 02:50.420
So if you head into index.html and after the image tag we're going to add another attribute.

35
02:50.490 --> 02:55.860
So remember HTML attributes are things like the source or the alt tag etc..

36
02:55.890 --> 03:00.700
And the one that we want to add now is the class attribute.

37
03:00.870 --> 03:08.610
Now the class attribute allows us to differentiate all of our different HTML elements.

38
03:08.610 --> 03:14.530
So for example for this bacon image I'm going to give the class a name of bacon.

39
03:15.010 --> 03:21.000
And for the broccoli image I'm going to name this class broccoli.

40
03:21.000 --> 03:29.190
So now what I can do is instead of coloring all the images red so I'm going to go ahead and comment

41
03:29.190 --> 03:30.040
this out.

42
03:30.060 --> 03:36.960
So in CSS commenting is a little bit different from HTML in the sense that we have to use a forward slash

43
03:37.470 --> 03:45.840
a asterisk and then to end the block of comments we use another asterisk and a forward slash.

44
03:46.470 --> 03:53.830
So everything in between the asterisks will be commented out and won't be considered as code.

45
03:54.000 --> 03:57.690
So let's give our css files some sections, shall we?

46
03:57.690 --> 04:03.330
Let's say that the top section are our tag selectors.

47
04:04.140 --> 04:09.480
And the next section are our class selectors.

48
04:09.750 --> 04:18.090
So inside this section I'm going to tap into that bacon class in order to only change the styling for

49
04:18.090 --> 04:22.470
the bacon image and give it a background color of green.

50
04:22.470 --> 04:32.910
So to target a class rather than a tag the only difference is a full stop or a dot in front of the class.

51
04:32.940 --> 04:34.760
So my class is called bacon.

52
04:34.830 --> 04:41.900
So to use it as a selector I just say .bacon and the rest of the CSS rule looks exactly the same.

53
04:42.360 --> 04:49.820
And I'm going to say that for the bacon class I want the background color to be green.

54
04:50.830 --> 04:53.380
But for the broccoli class.

55
04:53.380 --> 04:59.260
Now make sure you don't have any typos because if you misspell the selector, the property or the

56
04:59.260 --> 05:02.250
value you might not get what you expect.

57
05:02.260 --> 05:08.440
For example what I've done here because they all need to be spelt exactly the same way as you spelt

58
05:08.440 --> 05:09.440
it inside

59
05:09.510 --> 05:13.000
your html code when you gave the class a name.

60
05:13.030 --> 05:18.380
So for our broccoli image we want the background color to be red.

61
05:20.000 --> 05:29.230
So now if we hit save then what's going to happen is that different styles will be applied to our two images.

62
05:29.240 --> 05:35.570
So even though they’re both image html elements, because this one has a class of bacon it's going to have

63
05:35.600 --> 05:39.330
a background color of green as we specified.

64
05:39.330 --> 05:45.020
And because this one has a class of broccoli it's going to have a background color of red.

65
05:45.050 --> 05:47.790
So let's just quickly verify and there we go.

66
05:47.810 --> 05:51.890
We've got our bacon that's colored in green telling you how healthy it is.

67
05:51.950 --> 05:57.250
We've got broccoli colored in red telling you how it's probably not edible.

68
05:57.380 --> 06:06.110
So for things like paragraph elements or image elements or anchor tags then it's very very rare that

69
06:06.110 --> 06:09.580
you'll want to style them exactly the same way.

70
06:09.770 --> 06:18.650
So by using the class as the selector you can better differentiate and and make more specific styling

71
06:18.650 --> 06:21.540
choices for your web site elements.
