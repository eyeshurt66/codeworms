All right, so we've really come pretty far in our journey of creating and beautifying this CV website

1
00:08.130 --> 00:13.590
that we have here, but we're no longer really aspiring to be computer science professors.

2
00:13.830 --> 00:16.620
So we're going to have to take a slightly different path.

3
00:16.950 --> 00:21.000
And instead, we want to be hired as web developers.

4
00:21.360 --> 00:24.810
Unfortunately, we're never going to get hired with a website that looks like this.

5
00:25.110 --> 00:27.570
So we have to aspire to greater heights.

6
00:27.960 --> 00:35.160
And we want to create a website that looks and resembles more like a professional personal site with

7
00:35.160 --> 00:41.490
a beautiful interface and a few brief notes about what you can do and how people can contact you.

8
00:41.670 --> 00:48.390
So we're going to pay homage to one of the best personal sites on the internet, which is this website

9
00:48.390 --> 00:49.440
by Sean Halpin.

10
00:49.440 --> 00:55.620
And for the rest of this module, we're going to make a website that looks more similar to this and

11
00:55.620 --> 00:59.760
less similar to our computer science professor's CV website.

12
00:59.970 --> 01:07.020
So once you're ready, I have a challenge for you and that is to create a brand new project.

13
01:07.470 --> 01:14.220
So that means you have to create a new folder called CSS - My Site, and you have to create an index.html

14
01:14.220 --> 01:16.350
page inside that folder.

15
01:16.830 --> 01:21.810
And then you're going to add all of that HTML boilerplate code that you will need for any website,

16
01:22.170 --> 01:24.930
and you're going to give your website a title of your name.

17
01:24.930 --> 01:25.800
So mine would be

18
01:26.040 --> 01:27.570
Angela Yu for example.

19
01:28.890 --> 01:34.920
And then you're going to create a CSS folder and a styles.css file, and then you're going to

20
01:34.920 --> 01:36.710
link up your styles.css

21
01:36.710 --> 01:42.690
file with your HTML file, and you're going to check to make sure that it works by giving your

22
01:42.690 --> 01:48.040
website an ugly blue background color or whichever other ugly colors you can think of.

23
01:48.420 --> 01:49.740
It's completely up to you.

24
01:50.070 --> 01:52.980
So pause the video now and complete this challenge.

25
01:54.980 --> 02:01.430
So inside, Atom, we're going to close off what we were previously working on, be that the CSS Bacon

26
02:01.430 --> 02:07.850
Fansite or the HTML personal site. If you've got any of these open then just right-click and remove

27
02:07.850 --> 02:09.980
it from the left hand pane.

28
02:10.550 --> 02:16.460
Now you're going to go into whichever folder you've decided to store all of your web development projects

29
02:16.850 --> 02:22.400
and you're going to right-click and create a new folder that is going to be called CSS -

30
02:22.580 --> 02:23.390
My Site.

31
02:25.150 --> 02:31.660
And you're going to go back to Atom, and you're going to add this to the left-hand pane by clicking

32
02:31.660 --> 02:33.070
on Add Project Folder.

33
02:33.280 --> 02:37.840
And the one that we're going to pick is that brand new folder that has nothing contained inside.

34
02:38.560 --> 02:38.880
All right.

35
02:38.890 --> 02:44.530
So here's our brand new project folder, and I'm going to go into it and create a new file.

36
02:44.900 --> 02:48.310
And this is going to be our homepage or our index.html.

37
02:48.820 --> 02:56.590
And inside this brand new HTML file, I'm going to add in the boilerplate code just by using auto-suggest.

38
02:57.010 --> 03:02.010
And I'm going to give my website a title of my name which is Angela Yu,

39
03:02.080 --> 03:02.650
that's me.

40
03:03.100 --> 03:11.490
And now I'm going to create a new folder inside this project folder, and it's going to be called CSS.

41
03:11.890 --> 03:17.530
And inside that CSS folder, I'm going to create a new styles.css file.

42
03:18.760 --> 03:25.060
So now I have a stylesheet, and I'm going to link it up with my HTML using it as an external style

43
03:25.060 --> 03:25.330
sheet.

44
03:25.330 --> 03:29.860
So I'm going to insert a link that has a relationship of stylesheet.

45
03:30.340 --> 03:34.470
Now you can also add a type of text/

46
03:34.700 --> 03:40.660
css, but this is optional if you want, and it doesn't really matter if you have it there or not.

47
03:41.260 --> 03:46.660
Now what does matter, though, is that you correctly point to where your styles.css exists.

48
03:47.320 --> 03:54.620
So in our case, it exists inside a folder called CSS at the same hierarchical level as our index.html

49
03:55.120 --> 03:59.020
which is the current file we're inside and then it's called styles.

50
03:59.020 --> 03:59.590
css.

51
04:00.250 --> 04:06.220
And finally, just to check that everything worked out correctly, let's go inside the body and let's

52
04:06.220 --> 04:13.990
add a background color of, say, blue, which is going to be that pretty awful looking color.

53
04:14.440 --> 04:20.380
But now we can check to make sure that everything worked by right-clicking on the index.html and

54
04:20.380 --> 04:27.280
clicking on copy full path, then going into chrome and just pasting that into the browser bar.

55
04:27.670 --> 04:28.650
And there we go.

56
04:28.660 --> 04:35.110
This is our brand new, beautiful site that is just a blue background, but that means that everything

57
04:35.110 --> 04:39.880
we've done so far has worked out, and you can see our title is showing up, up here as well.

58
04:40.150 --> 04:46.210
And I'm going to get rid of this, and I'm going to close down this previous site we had back over here

59
04:46.210 --> 04:51.850
and we're now going to focus on working on this new site that we're creating and we're going to try

60
04:51.850 --> 04:56.110
and make it look similar to a professional web designer's personal site.
