00:00.800 --> 00:07.610
So in the last lesson, we've started this brand new project where we're going to recreate a professional

1
00:07.610 --> 00:09.590
web designer's personal site

2
00:09.920 --> 00:15.110
and we're going to make it look as beautiful, if not more beautiful than what we see here.

3
00:15.560 --> 00:20.000
So we started off strong by adding a favicon to our website.

4
00:20.210 --> 00:27.350
But our website is right now just a blue screen, which is not that professional and not that pretty.

5
00:27.620 --> 00:29.720
So let's go ahead and change it.

6
00:30.350 --> 00:35.840
So head over to Atom, and the first thing we're going to do is we're going to get rid of that awful

7
00:35.840 --> 00:36.680
background color.

8
00:36.980 --> 00:42.140
And I'm actually going to just delete this entire body section here, and I'm going to begin by having

9
00:42.140 --> 00:47.630
no styles whatsoever, and I'm going to first specify the structure of our website.

10
00:48.050 --> 00:52.370
Let's start off by recreating the content of this top part.

11
00:52.610 --> 00:58.460
So there's what seems to be an h1 and something that's just a paragraph just below it.

12
00:58.820 --> 01:02.510
And then there's a few images, and then we go on to the next part.

13
01:02.810 --> 01:04.880
So let's do that for ours as well.

14
01:05.390 --> 01:12.230
So let's go into the body and we're going to create an h1 that's going to say, I'm Angela.

15
01:13.490 --> 01:20.120
And after that, we're going to create a paragraph that's just going to say 'a programmer' and let's hit

16
01:20.120 --> 01:22.670
save and let's check it out.

17
01:23.870 --> 01:24.590
So there we go.

18
01:24.620 --> 01:26.390
Looks pretty boring, right?

19
01:26.570 --> 01:28.820
And it looks nothing like this.

20
01:29.540 --> 01:38.180
So the difference here is that, you see, these two parts are kind of grouped together in what might be

21
01:38.180 --> 01:38.930
a box.

22
01:39.410 --> 01:45.830
And if you look at ours, and if I turn on pesticide, which is a really, really useful tool when you're

23
01:45.830 --> 01:49.220
debugging your CSS. Now, you don't need to download it,

24
01:49.400 --> 01:54.590
but if you want to head over to the lesson where we covered internal CSS where I showed you step by

25
01:54.590 --> 02:01.970
step how to install Pesticide for Chrome. So you can see that what it does is that it highlights all

26
02:01.970 --> 02:07.100
of your HTML elements and essentially all of the boxes that are on-screen.

27
02:08.540 --> 02:14.750
So as we mentioned before, essentially all that we're doing when we're using success is we're specifying

28
02:14.750 --> 02:19.400
the style for how each of these HTML elements should be displayed.

29
02:19.850 --> 02:23.240
And each HTML element is basically just a box.

30
02:23.750 --> 02:29.230
So you can see that we've got a box up here, which is the h1 and a box down here, which is the paragraph.

31
02:29.510 --> 02:32.630
And that the box that's all around them is actually the body.

32
02:33.020 --> 02:38.660
And using Pesticide, you can confirm this by holding down the Control button and hovering over each

33
02:38.660 --> 02:39.920
section that you're interested in.

34
02:40.220 --> 02:44.870
So if I hover over here, you can see that this is showing me that it's a paragraph element,

35
02:45.380 --> 02:52.220
and up here is an h1, and in between and all around is the body, and that's what the blue line is.

36
02:52.280 --> 02:53.720
So this can be quite useful.

37
02:54.110 --> 03:02.360
Now what you might realize now is that we might want to have a box that's around this heading and the

38
03:02.360 --> 03:09.950
paragraph tag that we can expand its height and also push down our text to the center of it.

39
03:10.400 --> 03:12.580
So we can do this in a number of ways,

40
03:12.590 --> 03:18.290
but the way that I'm going to talk about here is an HTML element called the div.

41
03:18.740 --> 03:26.180
So let's go back into our index.html and I'm going to create a new element called a div.

42
03:27.280 --> 03:30.070
And we're just going to ignore the class for now.

43
03:30.340 --> 03:38.560
This div is a special HTML element that allows us to divide our content up on our website so that we

44
03:38.560 --> 03:43.870
can structure each div separately. Now by itself

45
03:44.200 --> 03:45.670
it doesn't do anything.

46
03:45.670 --> 03:53.290
So if I save this div here and I head back over to Chrome and I turn off Pesticide and refresh, you

47
03:53.290 --> 03:56.500
can see that nothing, absolutely nothing, has changed.

48
03:56.920 --> 04:01.750
And that's one of the reasons why we're talking about an HTML element inside our CSS module.

49
04:02.230 --> 04:09.160
And it's because divs, amongst other things, don't do anything unless you use CSS with it.

50
04:09.670 --> 04:17.050
So if we turn on Pesticide again, you can see that this top part of the body has now got a little bit

51
04:17.170 --> 04:18.400
thicker of a line.

52
04:19.180 --> 04:26.860
And if you right-click on it and try to inspect it, then we can select that div over here inside the

53
04:26.860 --> 04:27.790
elements tab.

54
04:28.270 --> 04:36.400
And if you scroll this graphic up, you can see that it's showing you that it has a width of 1,424 pixels

55
04:36.760 --> 04:41.940
and a height of 0 pixels, which is why we can't see anything.

56
04:41.950 --> 04:47.090
It's something that's 0 pixels high, even though it has a width, so it doesn't appear.

57
04:47.710 --> 04:50.920
Now what you see up here, where it says the outline,

58
04:50.950 --> 04:56.710
now this comes from Pesticide, and that's trying to show you where that div exists, even though it

59
04:56.710 --> 04:57.970
has no dimensions.

60
04:58.840 --> 05:03.370
Now, if we turn it off, then that goes away, and this is what our code actually looks like.

61
05:03.430 --> 05:10.060
So in order for that div to have a function, or in order to do anything, we have to use CSS.

62
05:10.540 --> 05:18.970
So let's select that div inside Chrome developer tools and let's specify some CSS for it inside our

63
05:18.970 --> 05:19.810
developer tools.

64
05:20.230 --> 05:26.440
So remember, anything that we specify here doesn't get saved, and its only purpose is for us to experiment

65
05:26.560 --> 05:28.000
and see it live immediately.

66
05:28.390 --> 05:36.880
So let's give it a background color of blue, my favorite color, and you can see nothing has changed.

67
05:37.180 --> 05:45.970
But if I give it a height of, say 100 pixels, then immediately you can see it now appears, and here

68
05:45.970 --> 05:47.110
is our div.

69
05:47.410 --> 05:48.580
This is where it is.

70
05:49.420 --> 05:52.510
And if you hover over it, that's what's going to be highlighted,

71
05:52.810 --> 05:58.870
and if I turn on Pesticide again, you can see now if I hold down Control and hover over, you can see

72
05:58.870 --> 06:04.120
that if I turn on Control and hover over this section, it's showing you this is the div, this is the

73
06:04.170 --> 06:05.520
h1 and this is the P.

74
06:05.860 --> 06:10.780
So the div is only there for you to structure and divide up your content.

75
06:10.990 --> 06:18.520
So if we wanted our div to perform a similar function to what we've got up here, which is the top

76
06:18.520 --> 06:25.930
part of the content where he's grouped together a title, a subtitle and an image, then we can do that

77
06:25.930 --> 06:26.740
using a div.

78
06:27.700 --> 06:32.890
Now remember what I said before about how the changes that you implement in the Chrome developer tools

79
06:33.100 --> 06:34.930
don't persist in your code?

80
06:35.200 --> 06:39.280
So if you check back in Atom, you won't see any extra code being added.

81
06:39.580 --> 06:45.400
And if you refresh this site, then all of those things that you entered inside here will disappear.

82
06:45.610 --> 06:47.860
So that's just for testing, basically.

83
06:48.520 --> 06:52.750
So let's head back to Atom, and let's do something with this div.

84
06:53.200 --> 07:00.970
So essentially, a div stands for a content division element, and it basically allows you to split

85
07:00.970 --> 07:07.510
up or divide your content into separate containers or boxes so that you can affect the layout of each

86
07:07.510 --> 07:13.840
box separately so that you can say that maybe these two things should be grouped together, and I'm

87
07:13.840 --> 07:19.900
going to structure it and style it separately from other content in my website.

88
07:20.770 --> 07:28.630
So divs, as we saw before, can have a height if you specified it using the styles, but it'll also

89
07:28.630 --> 07:30.790
have a height if it has content.

90
07:31.210 --> 07:40.420
So if we go ahead and move our heading and our paragraph inside our div here and hit save, then you'll

91
07:40.420 --> 07:43.390
see that if we bring up the Chrome developer tools again,

92
07:45.060 --> 07:52.320
that this div now has a height, it has a height of 76. something pixels and that's

93
07:52.320 --> 07:57.630
just enough to fit all the content that's inside, which is the h1 and the paragraph.

94
07:58.410 --> 08:02.490
Now let's give it a permanent background color so that we can see it more easily.

95
08:02.790 --> 08:06.060
And to do that, we have to go into our stylesheet.

96
08:06.390 --> 08:13.410
But before we do that, let's go to colorhunt.io and find a good color that we might want to use.

97
08:13.950 --> 08:16.980
So I'm actually going to stick to the same color palette I had before,

98
08:16.980 --> 08:19.890
and so maybe something like this.

99
08:20.960 --> 08:27.800
And if we head back into Atom and go into our stylesheet, then we can select our div and we're going

100
08:27.800 --> 08:32.540
to change its background color to that particular hex code.

101
08:33.650 --> 08:41.210
Now if we hit Save and we go back to our website and we hit refresh, then you'll see that our div now

102
08:41.210 --> 08:46.220
has a background color and we can see that box of the div more clearly.

103
08:46.790 --> 08:52.670
Now the strange thing is, why does that div not go all the way to the end

104
08:52.970 --> 08:58.100
on the left and on the top? It sort of stops just about here.

105
08:58.220 --> 08:59.120
Why is that?

106
08:59.570 --> 09:04.390
Well, remember how we said that the browser inserts their own default

107
09:04.430 --> 09:11.300
CSS to style things? For example, how the horizontal rules should look like or how the h1a should

108
09:11.300 --> 09:11.870
look like.

109
09:12.680 --> 09:19.850
Well, if you take a look at the body element, then you'll see that there's this user agent stylesheet

110
09:19.880 --> 09:23.870
which we know to be the default styles that are applied by the browser.

111
09:24.260 --> 09:29.630
And you can see that it has a margin of 8 pixels from all the edges.

112
09:30.170 --> 09:37.580
So if we change this and we can do that just down here by double-clicking on it and then let's enter

113
09:37.580 --> 09:38.210
zero.

114
09:38.540 --> 09:43.880
Now, if I hit enter, you'll see that that left margin now disappears.

115
09:44.570 --> 09:48.080
Now you might think that we can do the same thing with the top margin.

116
09:48.080 --> 09:53.840
So if I delete that and hit enter, then you would think that maybe our div would go all the way up

117
09:53.840 --> 09:54.530
to the top,

118
09:54.680 --> 09:55.640
but it doesn't.

119
09:55.880 --> 09:57.140
Now why is that?

120
09:57.170 --> 10:02.600
Well, because there's also default rules for our h1.

121
10:03.140 --> 10:09.800
And as you can see, when I hover over the h1, it already shows you the entire space that it's

122
10:09.800 --> 10:10.550
taking up.

123
10:11.060 --> 10:14.150
And you can see that inside the user agent stylesheet,

124
10:14.420 --> 10:17.180
it's got a whole bunch of default styles.

125
10:17.660 --> 10:25.850
For example, it says that it should have a margin before, of this amount, and a margin after, of this

126
10:25.850 --> 10:26.170
amount.

127
10:26.180 --> 10:31.670
So margin before is at the top, margin after is at the bottom. Margin

128
10:31.670 --> 10:35.150
start is on the left, margin end is on the right.

129
10:35.510 --> 10:41.420
So this margin is what is responsible for that little gap that we still have.

130
10:41.780 --> 10:48.920
So if I go ahead and change this to zero, then you can see now our div is now sticking right to the

131
10:48.920 --> 10:50.630
top of the page.

132
10:50.810 --> 10:58.400
Now, as you remember these changes, whether if I edit it here or if I edit it inside the style section

133
10:58.400 --> 11:01.460
here, so I can say margin-

134
11:02.960 --> 11:03.800
right

135
11:05.110 --> 11:07.930
is zero pixels as well,

136
11:08.350 --> 11:11.200
then I get rid of that right little space.

137
11:11.590 --> 11:13.840
But remember, none of this is permanent.

138
11:14.170 --> 11:22.150
So the challenge for you is to go and implement these styles in order to override the default browser

139
11:22.150 --> 11:29.950
styles and make our div go all the way to all three edges; the left, the top and the right.

140
11:30.400 --> 11:33.190
So pause the video and give that a go.

141
11:36.230 --> 11:43.160
All right, so all we need to do is just to transplant these changes we made here over to our stylesheet.

142
11:43.610 --> 11:49.400
So you'll notice that when I select, for example, the heading and I double click on the margin and

143
11:49.400 --> 11:56.900
I hit zero, then you'll see that it inserts this line of CSS code here, where it says the margin-top

144
11:56.900 --> 11:58.190
should be zero pixels.

145
11:58.340 --> 12:00.590
So I'm just going to do that again from the bottom here.

146
12:01.070 --> 12:05.690
I'm just going to hit zero, and I want you to watch over here what shows up.

147
12:07.340 --> 12:12.470
It's written some more code telling us that the margin-bottom should be zero pixels as well.

148
12:12.860 --> 12:18.650
So we now know what is the CSS that we have to write for our stylesheet in order for it to have

149
12:18.650 --> 12:19.850
the same appearance.

150
12:20.390 --> 12:25.310
So let's head over to our stylesheet and let's go ahead and select

151
12:25.640 --> 12:32.360
firstly, the body element, and we're going to override that 8-pixel margin that it has.

152
12:32.630 --> 12:40.280
And we're just going to say margin is zero, and this means that all four sides is going to be set to

153
12:40.280 --> 12:42.950
zero pixels for its margin property.

154
12:44.180 --> 12:49.640
The other one that we want to change was the h1, and this one, we don't really care so much about the

155
12:49.640 --> 12:50.600
other three sides.

156
12:50.930 --> 12:57.110
All we care is about the margin-top and we want to set this to zero pixels.

157
12:57.290 --> 13:04.010
So when it's zero, you don't actually have to specify the unit, so pixels or whatever else it may

158
13:04.010 --> 13:04.340
be.

159
13:04.460 --> 13:11.720
So now go ahead and hit save and head back to our website, and let's close this down and refresh,

160
13:11.720 --> 13:15.920
and you can see that our div now goes to all three edges.

161
13:16.550 --> 13:18.710
Now what is this diagram all about?

162
13:18.740 --> 13:23.120
It's got this margin, border, padding and all of these things.

163
13:23.270 --> 13:29.240
Well, that's what we're going to dig into in the next lesson where we talk about the CSS box model.

164
13:29.510 --> 13:30.530
So, I'll see you there.
