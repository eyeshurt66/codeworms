0
00:00.990 --> 00:01.340
All right.

1
00:01.350 --> 00:10.140
So in the last lesson there was a pdf that you could download which showed the end result of our web

2
00:10.140 --> 00:13.720
site and it shows how things would be laid out,

3
00:13.740 --> 00:20.790
what is the rough spacing between each of the elements and how everything should look and feel.

4
00:20.820 --> 00:25.900
Now I've also specified the hex codes for the colors that I'm using here.

5
00:26.040 --> 00:31.260
And I also showed you how you can go about getting hold of this button code.

6
00:31.260 --> 00:35.340
Now in this lesson I'm going to show you how I implemented this,

7
00:35.550 --> 00:40.220
adding in the rest of the CSS code that we need to achieve this look.

8
00:40.350 --> 00:47.010
Now it might just be that your code, based on what you estimated visually, is a little bit different from

9
00:47.010 --> 00:48.200
what I'm going to type.

10
00:48.270 --> 00:50.490
That's not a problem at all.

11
00:50.490 --> 00:58.440
Now you can either follow along with what I'm doing in the solution or you can simply watch it just

12
00:58.440 --> 01:00.800
to see if you got the broad strokes right.

13
01:00.810 --> 01:04.010
For example how did you implement the horizontal rule,

14
01:04.060 --> 01:08.360
or how do I get this bottom footer section to look like this?

15
01:08.430 --> 01:13.360
Now it doesn't matter if your web site looks similar to mine or not.

16
01:13.380 --> 01:20.850
In fact, I encourage you to personalize your web site, but I want you to be able to achieve the layouts

17
01:20.940 --> 01:22.500
that I've specified.

18
01:22.530 --> 01:28.890
So after you're able to look at a specification like this. Now, I admit this is a very rough spec and

19
01:28.890 --> 01:36.120
I haven't given you the specific margins and paddings etc., but it's a great skill as a web designer

20
01:36.120 --> 01:44.250
to be able to look at a sketched out layout or a mockup and to be able to implement that in code inside

21
01:44.260 --> 01:46.430
your CSS and HTML.

22
01:46.560 --> 01:54.240
So let's get going and feel free to follow along with me or just watch the solution video to see how

23
01:54.240 --> 01:56.280
to do something that you couldn't figure out.

24
01:56.280 --> 02:02.130
So the first thing I'm going to change is that I'm going to change the body text color to a slightly

25
02:02.610 --> 02:05.820
off black, and that's the color I specified here,

26
02:05.830 --> 02:07.780
40514E.

27
02:07.950 --> 02:12.830
So let's head over to our body and let's add that font color here.

28
02:13.050 --> 02:15.690
So that's going to be changing the color property.

29
02:15.900 --> 02:28.140
And it is 40514E, and that's this sort of dark greyish color that we're going to implement for

30
02:28.140 --> 02:30.720
the text inside our web site.

31
02:30.780 --> 02:35.940
And that just makes it look a little bit more designed than previously but it's still highly readable.

32
02:35.940 --> 02:41.430
So be careful about using really light greys when you're changing the body color because if there's

33
02:41.520 --> 02:47.130
not enough contrast with the background color then it can make it really difficult, not just people with

34
02:47.130 --> 02:50.710
visual impairment but even normal people would be a strain on their eyes.

35
02:50.760 --> 02:53.450
So always go for something dark and high contrast.

36
02:53.610 --> 02:59.340
Now the next thing that I want is to have a little bit more padding between the h2s and the text

37
02:59.340 --> 02:59.990
below them.

38
02:59.990 --> 03:07.110
So for example I want just a bit more space between the Hello and this bio, and also My Skills and the

39
03:07.110 --> 03:08.330
skills section.

40
03:08.340 --> 03:18.920
So let's head over to our h2 and add that padding-bottom, and I'm going to add only about 10 pixels

41
03:19.040 --> 03:20.230
to achieve that.

42
03:20.390 --> 03:25.740
So you can see the effect is really subtle but it helps to space things out a little bit.

43
03:25.760 --> 03:31.810
Now the next thing I want is a bit of space between the middle section and the top section.

44
03:31.850 --> 03:38.810
So I'm going to add again 100 pixels of padding to the top and 100 pixels to the bottom to space it

45
03:38.810 --> 03:41.920
out between the middle, the top and the bottom containers.

46
03:42.080 --> 03:45.720
But I don't want to add any further margin to the left and right, 

47
03:45.890 --> 03:52.370
so I'm going to leave it as 0 so that it's stuck to the left and right sides of the viewport, which is

48
03:52.370 --> 03:53.550
the screen.

49
03:54.230 --> 03:59.240
So in order to do that I'm going to use the shorthand, where I say it's 100 pixels for the top

50
03:59.270 --> 04:02.860
and bottom and 0 for the left and right.

51
04:02.870 --> 04:10.070
So let's hit save and refresh and you see we've now got a good bit of space between the top and bottom containers.

52
04:10.070 --> 04:13.170
And that looks a lot more natural than before.

53
04:13.190 --> 04:22.040
Now the next thing I'm going to do is, I want to format this little bit of bio here so that it's less

54
04:22.130 --> 04:27.880
in width, and you can have a few more lines rather than this long line that's quite hard to read.

55
04:28.190 --> 04:31.230
And so I can do that by changing it’s width.

56
04:31.460 --> 04:39.660
So if I go into my index.html, and I already have this class for that paragraph which is called 

57
04:39.670 --> 04:40.580
intro.

58
04:40.730 --> 04:44.350
You might have called it something else or you may or may not have this class.

59
04:44.390 --> 04:48.160
Just check to see what you called this class over here.

60
04:48.440 --> 04:53.350
And then we can target it inside our styles.css.

61
04:53.450 --> 04:56.090
And I'm just going to put it below the pro class.

62
04:56.120 --> 04:57.990
So it's called intro,

63
04:58.670 --> 05:05.780
and I'm going to change its width to only 30 percent of its parent container, which is of course the middle

64
05:05.780 --> 05:06.340
container.

65
05:06.350 --> 05:14.270
So let's hit refresh and you can see it's now a lot less in width and it's now taking up three lines,

66
05:14.600 --> 05:18.740
which is much easier to read rather than one long big line.

67
05:18.790 --> 05:25.730
So, but the problem is now, it's left aligned and it's no longer in the center of our web page, and that's

68
05:25.730 --> 05:30.420
because it's no longer edge to edge and we now have to set the margin to

69
05:30.470 --> 05:31.220
auto

70
05:31.400 --> 05:36.250
in order to get it to be centered in the web page, which is exactly what we want.

71
05:36.470 --> 05:42.830
So I'm going to go ahead and add a margin property and just set it to auto on all four sides.

72
05:42.980 --> 05:48.630
And now you can see it's perfectly centered and it looks a lot nicer than before.

73
05:48.660 --> 05:55.310
So one of the things I added here was to make the line height double what it used to be and that spaces

74
05:55.310 --> 05:58.200
out the text and makes it a lot easier to read.

75
05:58.220 --> 06:01.660
Now I'd like to do that consistently across my web site,

76
06:01.670 --> 06:05.900
so for the intro as well as the other parts of text.

77
06:05.960 --> 06:14.660
So instead of having that line-height down in the skill-row section, I'm actually going to cut that

78
06:15.020 --> 06:19.280
and add that to a paragraph level

79
06:19.920 --> 06:20.960
CSS rule.

80
06:21.020 --> 06:28.010
So I'm targeting all the paragraphs inside my web site and I'm changing all of their line-heights to double

81
06:28.070 --> 06:29.370
the height that it used to be.

82
06:29.510 --> 06:33.620
And this makes it a lot more spaced out and a lot easier to read.

83
06:33.680 --> 06:37.870
Now finally I just want to adjust my clouds a little bit,

84
06:38.120 --> 06:41.990
just based on what I prefer it to look.

85
06:42.170 --> 06:48.260
So I'm going to change the top cloud to have 40 from the top rather than 300,

86
06:48.320 --> 06:53.180
make it go up a little bit, and then I'm going to make the bottom cloud

87
06:53.240 --> 06:56.480
only have a left of 250,

88
06:56.500 --> 06:58.470
so make it go further to the left.

89
06:58.490 --> 06:58.750
All right.

90
06:58.760 --> 07:02.660
So that is pretty much the top sections done.

91
07:02.660 --> 07:07.490
Now the next thing we need to look at is this horizontal rule and at the moment it's looking a little

92
07:07.490 --> 07:08.340
bit ugly.

93
07:08.480 --> 07:14.960
But as we did previously, we managed to get these little grey dots to show up as the horizontal rule

94
07:15.140 --> 07:16.880
separating the sections instead.

95
07:16.940 --> 07:19.070
And that's what we want to do here also.

96
07:19.310 --> 07:23.130
So let's go ahead and target the horizontal rule.

97
07:23.660 --> 07:30.950
So, remember, because it's an HTML element we're going to put it with the other HTML elements, and we're

98
07:30.950 --> 07:38.960
going to first change the border so that it has a dotted style and I'm going to change the color to

99
07:39.350 --> 07:40.660
a light grey,

100
07:40.660 --> 07:51.120
so an EAF6F6, and I want it to be 6 pixels in width. So let's refresh that.

101
07:51.120 --> 08:00.930
Now you can see that there's now two borders of one above and one below and enclosing a zero pixel height

102
08:01.080 --> 08:02.770
horizontal rule.

103
08:02.760 --> 08:12.360
So if we now go and set the border-bottom to none, then we can get rid of that bottom border to only

104
08:12.360 --> 08:17.520
have a single line, which looks the way that we want it to.

105
08:17.520 --> 08:21.890
So the next thing is to change its width and I want it to be a lot narrower than that.

106
08:21.900 --> 08:31.070
In fact, I want it only to be about maybe 4 percent of the width, and it's important to use percent here so

107
08:31.070 --> 08:38.660
that it scales when my web site scales, and finally I need to give it some margin, because at the

108
08:38.660 --> 08:41.070
moment it's far too close to everything else.

109
08:41.210 --> 08:48.860
So I want it to have 100 pixels of margin-top, 100 pixels margin-bottom, and I want it to be centered

110
08:49.070 --> 08:49.940
in the middle.

111
08:49.940 --> 08:53.210
So we're going to go for that good old margin property,

112
08:53.240 --> 08:59.150
and we're going to say top and bottom should be 100 pixels, and left and right should be auto, so that

113
08:59.180 --> 09:05.010
we keep this centered in the middle. And that is looking really really nice.

114
09:05.060 --> 09:09.950
And I know it's a very very light color but it's fine because it doesn't need to be read, 

115
09:10.040 --> 09:13.430
it’s just there to visually separate some of our section.

116
09:13.490 --> 09:19.220
Now the next section that we get to is, of course, this Contact Me section, and the first thing I want

117
09:19.220 --> 09:26.180
to do is similar to this intro or bio bit of text. I need to make this Contact Me message a little bit

118
09:26.180 --> 09:27.730
less wide.

119
09:27.830 --> 09:36.320
So let's target that and change its width. So, the contact message currently has a class called 

120
09:36.320 --> 09:37.270
contact-message.

121
09:37.280 --> 09:42.720
So let's go ahead and target that inside our CSS,

122
09:42.770 --> 09:52.380
so .contact-message, and we're going to change its width. And I'm going to change it to just 40 percent

123
09:52.390 --> 10:00.610
in this case, and that will make it go onto two lines but it will also make it go to the left.

124
10:00.640 --> 10:08.450
So let's change the margin so that we have 40 pixels from the top and 40 pixels from the bottom,

125
10:08.680 --> 10:11.820
but the left and right should be auto.

126
10:11.950 --> 10:19.190
Now the shorthand way of specifying that is by using the three element circle rule, 

127
10:19.330 --> 10:27.290
so that's 40 pixels from the top, auto for the left and right and 60 pixels for the bottom. Again,

128
10:27.310 --> 10:29.490
if that confuses you at all,

129
10:29.500 --> 10:35.690
make sure you take a look at the MDN Developer Docs for the margin property.

130
10:36.010 --> 10:39.790
So hit save and we've now got more margin here than here, 

131
10:39.940 --> 10:43.900
and it's also spaced so that it's automatically centered in the middle.

132
10:43.900 --> 10:49.330
Now the final thing in this section is of course changing that Contact Me button from this horrible

133
10:49.360 --> 10:54.000
ugly looking thing to something that looks a little bit more like a real button.

134
10:54.250 --> 11:01.480
And as we mentioned in the challenge we're going to use the CSS Button Generator web site. So the text

135
11:01.540 --> 11:04.240
I'm going to change to CONTACT ME, 

136
11:04.270 --> 11:05.290
all caps,

137
11:05.290 --> 11:12.250
the font-family we’ll leave as Arial for now, the font-color is just going to be white, and the font-size

138
11:12.250 --> 11:15.730
we’re going to leave as 20 pixels as well.

139
11:15.730 --> 11:20.860
Now we're not going to change anything in the box but we are going to change the border and specifically

140
11:20.860 --> 11:22.530
that's the border radius.

141
11:22.600 --> 11:28.080
I'm going to change it down to 8 so that it's a little bit more square looking rather than rounded.

142
11:28.390 --> 11:34.420
And it's not going to have a border but it is going to have a gradient background and the starting color

143
11:34.420 --> 11:40.690
for our gradient is going to be 11CDD4,

144
11:41.110 --> 11:47.010
and the end color is going to be 11999E.

145
11:47.320 --> 11:56.590
And for our hover or rollover state, we're going to start the gradient at 30E3CB, and we're going

146
11:56.590 --> 12:02.500
to end at 2BC4AD.

147
12:02.510 --> 12:07.530
All right so now you can see that when you hover over it it's a little bit lighter shade of green.

148
12:07.690 --> 12:09.750
So that looks pretty nice to me.

149
12:09.880 --> 12:16.030
And this is the automatically generated CSS code based on all of those options that we've selected.

150
12:16.180 --> 12:22.310
And we can now just copy it wholesale and paste it into our CSS over here.

151
12:22.630 --> 12:33.010
Now if you take a look at our anchor tag for our contact button, you can see it has a class of btn, and

152
12:33.010 --> 12:39.420
that matches perfectly with the class that we get back from CSS Button Generator,

153
12:39.520 --> 12:42.940
and that means that we will be able to target it without a problem.

154
12:42.940 --> 12:49.420
Now the only thing that I want to change here is, I want to change the text so that it fits in with our

155
12:49.420 --> 12:52.460
font-family that we've set for the entire web site.

156
12:52.540 --> 13:00.490
I’m going to change the font-family from Arial to Montserrat. And now if we hit save and we go ahead and

157
13:00.490 --> 13:06.280
refresh our page, you can see that we've got that beautiful button that we've implemented without

158
13:06.430 --> 13:07.990
very much work at all.

159
13:07.990 --> 13:13.780
All right. So now we're finally ready to tackle the bottom section which is basically our footer that

160
13:13.780 --> 13:15.610
you'll see on most web pages.

161
13:15.730 --> 13:21.310
Now the first thing that we want to do is, we want to change its background color so that we can see

162
13:21.310 --> 13:24.730
the difference between the footer and the middle section.

163
13:24.730 --> 13:31.810
So find the bottom-container, and let's go ahead and change its background color to the color that we've

164
13:31.810 --> 13:40.990
been using for a while now which is 66BFBF, and let's hit save and refresh. You can see we've now got

165
13:41.290 --> 13:46.200
this bottom section highlighted and separated from the rest of the content.

166
13:46.210 --> 13:52.190
Now why is there this gap between the bottom of our page and the bottom of our footer?

167
13:52.480 --> 13:58.140
Well, the reason, if you inspect, is that you can scroll it all the way up to the top,

168
13:58.330 --> 14:06.010
and if you hover over that paragraph for the last copyright message you can see that it's got a pretty

169
14:06.010 --> 14:10.090
large margin, 16 from the top and 16 from the bottom.

170
14:10.180 --> 14:16.610
And remember that came automatically from the user agent stylesheet which comes from the browser.

171
14:16.660 --> 14:20.010
And that's 1em top and 1em bottom.

172
14:20.020 --> 14:26.620
So we have to either get rid of that padding or we can pad out our footer a little bit more and make

173
14:26.620 --> 14:33.020
it a little bit taller so that it encompasses that padding for the paragraph tag.

174
14:33.190 --> 14:34.540
I'll show you what I mean.

175
14:34.540 --> 14:43.720
So if we go into our bottom-container and we change the padding to 50 pixels up top, 0 left and right,

176
14:43.990 --> 14:50.410
and 20 pixels at the bottom, then that should be more than enough to cover the 16 pixels which is the

177
14:50.420 --> 14:54.710
1em padding for our paragraph.

178
14:54.730 --> 15:01.450
So if we hit refresh you'll see now our footer goes all the way down to the bottom and there is now

179
15:01.450 --> 15:07.490
enough space for that padding to be included inside the footer rather than outside the footer.

180
15:07.660 --> 15:10.580
So next let’s style our anchor tags.

181
15:10.630 --> 15:15.970
Currently they're a little bit too squished up together and it's not looking very nice.

182
15:16.000 --> 15:23.440
So let's go ahead and target them by targeting all of the anchor tags and lets first change the text

183
15:23.440 --> 15:32.690
color to what we have in the rest of our document and the text color that I specified was 11999E.

184
15:32.890 --> 15:38.910
And let's add the property, of course, and that's hit save and refresh.

185
15:38.980 --> 15:45.760
You can see that we've now got a slightly lighter color than before but it's still relatively readable

186
15:45.760 --> 15:46.760
against the background.

187
15:46.810 --> 15:52.900
Now you can of course make that contrast more if you wish to but I usually think that the text in the

188
15:52.900 --> 15:53.590
footer,

189
15:53.710 --> 15:58.600
you don't want it to distract from the main message which is either Contact Me or whatever it is that

190
15:58.600 --> 16:00.240
you want to highlight to people.

191
16:00.280 --> 16:02.880
So I want to have that a little bit more muted.

192
16:02.980 --> 16:07.510
Now let's make this text look a little bit more in line with the rest of our text.

193
16:07.570 --> 16:13.270
You can see that the anchor text is actually styled in a different font from the rest of our text. So

194
16:13.420 --> 16:20.800
we can change that to what we've got for the rest of our body, which is Montserrat, by just copying this

195
16:20.800 --> 16:24.650
line over here, or, as you probably should to get more practice,

196
16:24.670 --> 16:25.720
just type it up.

197
16:26.050 --> 16:27.360
So let's update that.

198
16:27.430 --> 16:32.710
And we've got something that fits in with the overall look and feel of our web site.

199
16:32.800 --> 16:38.200
And now all we need to do is just space them apart a little bit so that they can be easily distinguished

200
16:38.260 --> 16:39.480
from each other.

201
16:39.790 --> 16:45.790
So to do that we're going to have to add a little bit of margin to it and I'm going to add a 10 pixel

202
16:45.790 --> 16:53.440
top and bottom margin and a 20 pixel left and right margin to give it more space away from each other,

203
16:53.590 --> 16:58.340
and this way we can click on each one individually without having them all mushed together.

204
16:58.630 --> 17:04.720
Now the final thing I don't like about this look is that by default all anchor tags have an underline

205
17:05.020 --> 17:07.950
that shows you that this is clickable.

206
17:07.950 --> 17:11.790
Now I want to show that in a different way by changing the hover state.

207
17:11.830 --> 17:19.720
So I want to get rid of this underline, and I can do that by changing the text-decoration which, remember,

208
17:19.720 --> 17:23.930
the browser automatically makes it underlined for all anchor tags,

209
17:24.110 --> 17:26.530
and I'm going to change it to none.

210
17:26.530 --> 17:27.860
So now we update that.

211
17:28.000 --> 17:28.570
That's gone.

212
17:28.600 --> 17:33.020
And that looks a lot nicer and it doesn't look like a 90s web site anymore,

213
17:33.040 --> 17:33.480
right?

214
17:33.670 --> 17:39.550
So as we said we want to show that these links are clickable by making it have a different color

215
17:39.640 --> 17:46.900
when I rollover it. So I can target that using the hover state of the anchor tag.

216
17:47.200 --> 17:52.250
And if you remember that we spoke about these pseudo classes a few lessons ago.

217
17:52.450 --> 17:58.430
And if you're confused about this at all then be sure to check out those previous lessons on the CSS

218
17:58.430 --> 17:59.810
selectors.

219
17:59.920 --> 18:05.500
So for the hover state, instead of having a fun color of 11999E,

220
18:05.650 --> 18:16.900
we instead want to have a EAF6F6, and that will just be a little bit lighter so that when we hover over

221
18:16.900 --> 18:22.510
it, it looks like it's definitely clickable and that gives the user enough clues as to what to do with

222
18:22.510 --> 18:23.210
it.

223
18:23.230 --> 18:30.010
Now the very very final thing that I'm going to format is the copyright here, and I'm going to change

224
18:30.010 --> 18:34.720
its color to make it less assuming and also make it a little bit smaller.

225
18:34.990 --> 18:39.340
So let's go ahead and see what we used for that copyright message.

226
18:39.390 --> 18:42.620
We used the class copyright.

227
18:42.630 --> 18:47.560
So let's go into our styles.css, find the part where we have the text,

228
18:47.560 --> 18:57.330
and let's go ahead and select the copyright message and change its color to the same as we had for our

229
18:57.330 --> 19:06.780
anchor tag rollover state which is EAF6F6, hit refresh, and see it's now this lovely light white color,

230
19:07.230 --> 19:09.870
and then we're going to make it a lot smaller.

231
19:09.900 --> 19:18.480
So we're going to change the font size to 0.75rem, so that's 75 percent of 16 pixels, and

232
19:18.570 --> 19:23.940
it's now less important and it's taking up less space as well.

233
19:23.940 --> 19:28.260
Now finally I want to give a little bit more padding from the top and the bottom.

234
19:28.260 --> 19:37.800
So I'm going to change its padding to maybe 20 pixels top and bottom and zero pixels left and right so

235
19:37.800 --> 19:39.780
that it goes all the way to the end.

236
19:39.780 --> 19:43.270
And that way it's got a little bit more separation from the top.

237
19:43.500 --> 19:46.300
And this looks a lot nicer than before.

238
19:46.590 --> 19:55.150
So that's all the changes that I have to make in order to fully recreate our specification here.

239
19:55.170 --> 20:02.100
Now if you had any problems such as implementing the buttons or changing the horizontal rules then be

240
20:02.100 --> 20:06.030
sure to try and fix it using this solution.

241
20:06.030 --> 20:11.160
Now at this stage if you're happy with everything that we've spoken about, feel free to go ahead and

242
20:11.160 --> 20:17.130
completely change or personalize this web site, change the color schemes, change the layouts to whatever

243
20:17.130 --> 20:18.760
it is that you prefer.

244
20:18.880 --> 20:27.750
But this is the live web site, and the next step is of course make it hosted on GitHub so that your

245
20:27.750 --> 20:34.200
personal site is live and you can share it with your friends and your family or show it to anybody who

246
20:34.200 --> 20:35.450
might want to employ you.

247
20:35.520 --> 20:37.950
So that's all for this section.

248
20:38.070 --> 20:46.380
But in this module we learnt a lot about CSS and styling and positioning and layout, changing the text,

249
20:46.380 --> 20:53.670
changing the colors, making text wrap around images, how to create hover states, and loads and loads more.

250
20:53.670 --> 21:00.960
So if any of this is not apparent immediately it might be worth reviewing some of the more difficult

251
21:00.960 --> 21:01.630
concepts,

252
21:01.740 --> 21:05.790
for example the positioning and the difference between absolute and relative.

253
21:05.790 --> 21:12.600
Or you could simply just go ahead and start creating a web design of your own fancy that you've designed,

254
21:12.870 --> 21:18.350
pencil and paper, and try to solve those problems by doing. So,

255
21:18.360 --> 21:21.240
that’s all from me in this lesson. I'll see you on the next lesson.
