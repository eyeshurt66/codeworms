So the first difference that you'll notice between our site and their site is that even in the tab bar,

1
00:06.360 --> 00:13.140
you can see that we've got this little new file icon here which is kind of devoid of any design,

2
00:13.530 --> 00:16.170
but he's got this cute little icon over here.

3
00:16.290 --> 00:18.630
So how do we get hold of one of those?

4
00:19.230 --> 00:23.160
Well, this is called a favicon or a favorite icon.

5
00:23.700 --> 00:30.150
And the reason it's called that is because back in the olden days when people were still using shock

6
00:30.150 --> 00:38.400
horror Internet Explorer 5, the favicon or the favorite icon was an icon that would show

7
00:38.400 --> 00:43.170
up in your browser bar if you were on a website that you had favorited.

8
00:44.130 --> 00:51.150
And a  cool side effect of that is that if you were the web developer, you can see how many times did people

9
00:51.150 --> 00:55.290
request to display your favicon

10
00:55.680 --> 01:01.740
and that would give you an estimate of how many people had bookmarked or favorited your website.

11
01:01.950 --> 01:07.410
But now that doesn't work anymore, because the browsers will try to display the favicon for all web

12
01:07.410 --> 01:09.780
sites, whether if you favorited it or not.

13
01:10.320 --> 01:13.680
But it's a nice little touch, and this is something that we want to implement.

14
01:14.160 --> 01:21.120
Now, if you want to do this, just head over to favicon.cc and here you can create a brand new

15
01:21.120 --> 01:21.750
favicon.

16
01:21.990 --> 01:29.160
Now you can either import an image, maybe of yourself, and it will try to turn it into a very coarse

17
01:29.160 --> 01:29.730
drawing,

18
01:30.060 --> 01:31.740
or you can just simply draw it yourself.

19
01:31.800 --> 01:39.360
So I'm just going to draw one myself, and I'm just going to draw a capital A as best as I can, which

20
01:39.360 --> 01:40.740
is not that well.

21
01:47.420 --> 01:48.790
All right, so here's my favicon.

22
01:49.190 --> 01:56.270
And you can see that this is what it would look like when it's being used, so you can go ahead and

23
01:56.270 --> 01:59.330
refine it however you want to make it look nice.

24
01:59.690 --> 02:02.840
And this is where you really unleash your creative talents,

25
02:02.840 --> 02:07.460
and because I don't have many, then this is what I'm going to go with.

26
02:07.640 --> 02:14.720
So now we can download our favicon, which is in a special format for favicons which is the ico

27
02:14.720 --> 02:16.100
or an icon format.

28
02:16.430 --> 02:22.760
And then I'm going to pull up the folder where I've got my CSS - My Site that contains my index.html

29
02:22.770 --> 02:30.650
and my CSS folders, and I'm just going to click and drag this newly downloaded favicon into

30
02:30.650 --> 02:31.520
the same folder.

31
02:31.940 --> 02:36.170
And now, if you head into Atom, you'll be able to see it in the Project Navigator as well.

32
02:36.740 --> 02:40.970
And in order to incorporate it to our website, we're going to create a new link.

33
02:41.510 --> 02:43.280
But this link has a different relationship.

34
02:43.280 --> 02:50.210
It's not the stylesheet in this case, it's actually just the icon, and the icon is located at the

35
02:50.210 --> 02:53.960
same hierarchical level as our index.html.

36
02:54.440 --> 02:59.530
We just have to put its name down, so the file is called favicon.ico.

37
02:59.810 --> 03:07.100
So now if we hit save and we go over to our browser and go to our site and hit refresh, then you'll

38
03:07.100 --> 03:13.280
see that it now has a pretty little favicon that shows up, which is pretty neat right? Now

39
03:13.280 --> 03:19.220
if after doing all of that, you still don't see your favicon, try changing the href of your

40
03:19.220 --> 03:21.860
favicon link to this instead.

41
03:21.890 --> 03:27.740
Add the "?v=2" because it might be that your browser has cached a previous version

42
03:28.040 --> 03:30.920
or is just trying to create a default one that it's placed there.

43
03:31.250 --> 03:34.760
So if you change this, it should allow your favicon to show up.

44
03:35.270 --> 03:41.300
Now, if we take a look at Sean's site, you can see that it's got a whole bunch of distinct sections

45
03:41.300 --> 03:42.680
which we can scroll through.

46
03:43.070 --> 03:45.740
So how can we do this for our web site?

47
03:46.160 --> 03:51.230
Certainly not by using anything that we've done so far because we haven't been able to do any sort of

48
03:51.230 --> 03:54.870
positioning or layout with our previous CV website.

49
03:55.460 --> 04:01.310
So in the next lesson, I'm going to show you how we can create these blocks inside our website that

50
04:01.310 --> 04:04.220
we can style and make it look something like this.

51
04:04.520 --> 04:08.750
So you'll have that to look forward to, and I'll see you on the next lesson.
