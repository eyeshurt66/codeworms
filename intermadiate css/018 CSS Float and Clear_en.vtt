00:00.420 --> 00:06.930
Now we're getting really, really close to the end result now, and all we need to do is start getting

1
00:06.930 --> 00:12.870
our skills section laid out in a way that looks a little bit better than this.

2
00:13.260 --> 00:18.420
So the first thing to notice is that if I switch on Pesticide, you can see that we've got the skill

3
00:18.420 --> 00:18.930
section,

4
00:19.260 --> 00:22.320
and inside the skill section, there's two divs.

5
00:22.590 --> 00:26.880
And if you look in the code, then you'll see exactly the same structure here.

6
00:27.150 --> 00:34.800
So this div is the skills div which contains two further divs, which are the skill rows.

7
00:35.100 --> 00:42.720
And if you prefer to visualize this a little bit easier by seeing which is the opening tag for the div

8
00:42.720 --> 00:44.250
and which one is the closing one,

9
00:44.580 --> 00:53.280
you can actually head into Atom and change your preferences in your editor section to show the indent guides.

10
00:53.640 --> 01:00.600
So now you can see that you've got these lines that show you which div matches with which closing element.

11
01:00.990 --> 01:05.700
Now, I actually prefer this off just because I find it to clustering.

12
01:05.940 --> 01:08.910
But it all depends on how you wish to visualize it.

13
01:09.420 --> 01:15.450
But the important thing is that we've got these two divs that represent two skill rows, and I want

14
01:15.450 --> 01:23.160
you to make each skill row have only 50% the width of the screen.

15
01:23.430 --> 01:28.200
So at the moment, it's 100%t because it's a block element,

16
01:28.650 --> 01:31.910
but I want you to change that to make it only 50%.

17
01:31.920 --> 01:34.800
So pause the video and complete the challenge.

18
01:37.190 --> 01:42.950
All right, so this shouldn't be too hard. If we head into our styles.css and we go ahead and

19
01:42.950 --> 01:50.210
add our skill row and just make sure that you check to see if you've got any typos between the way it's

20
01:50.210 --> 01:55.460
named here in the class attribute and the way that you've targeted it over here.

21
01:55.880 --> 02:03.440
So we want to change the width to 50% and we can hit save and refresh.

22
02:03.770 --> 02:10.670
And you can see that even though our width for the div is now 50% because it's no longer 100

23
02:10.670 --> 02:15.320
percent, it's no longer centered in the middle of our website.

24
02:15.740 --> 02:17.440
So how can we fix this?

25
02:17.450 --> 02:18.600
We've seen this before

26
02:18.620 --> 02:26.960
and as a challenge, I want you to restore this skill row to the center of the web page.

27
02:27.140 --> 02:29.990
So pause the video and see if you can figure out how to do that.

28
02:32.180 --> 02:38.840
So as we've seen before, the way that we achieve this is by setting the margin to be auto on the left

29
02:38.840 --> 02:40.010
and on the right.

30
02:40.490 --> 02:47.660
So let's go ahead and do that. So we can set the margin for this skill row to be auto

31
02:47.830 --> 02:54.800
and that just means auto on all four sides, which will center it if we refresh our web page.

32
02:55.040 --> 03:02.120
Now, at the moment, that div is a little bit too close to the top heading and to the next div.

33
03:02.450 --> 03:10.040
So how can you change the margin property so that we end up with 100px margin at the top and 100px

34
03:10.040 --> 03:11.450
margin at the bottom

35
03:11.810 --> 03:18.620
but keeping this margin auto on the left and right? Pause the video and see if you can complete this

36
03:18.620 --> 03:19.160
challenge.

37
03:21.020 --> 03:27.650
All right, so this goes back to the circle shorthand, so if we start from the top, as we always do,

38
03:27.920 --> 03:30.650
we're going to add 100px margin at the top.

39
03:31.190 --> 03:35.450
Next, we come clockwise to the right, which we want to keep as auto.

40
03:36.050 --> 03:41.580
Next, we go down to the bottom, which we said again, we want 100px margin.

41
03:41.600 --> 03:45.590
And finally, we have the left which we are going to set as auto.

42
03:45.890 --> 03:47.930
So the left and the right are auto,

43
03:47.930 --> 03:50.090
the top and the bottom are 100px.

44
03:50.540 --> 03:56.390
Let's hit save and let's refresh, and we can see that margin now in action.

45
03:56.780 --> 04:02.810
Now the next thing I want you to do is I want this text both the part for the design and development,

46
04:03.140 --> 04:07.230
as well as the description text to be left-aligned.

47
04:07.550 --> 04:13.580
So can you figure out which property you need to change and where in order to make that happen?

48
04:14.150 --> 04:16.490
So pause the video and complete the challenge.

49
04:19.170 --> 04:19.630
All right.

50
04:19.680 --> 04:25.710
So all we need to do is to go into the skill row and change the text-alight property.

51
04:26.160 --> 04:32.820
Remember, we changed this previously to make the text  center-aligned for most of the body, and that

52
04:32.820 --> 04:37.620
in itself aligned the images to be centered as well as all of our text.

53
04:38.070 --> 04:44.440
But in the skill row here, we want the tax to be left-aligned so we can change that value to the left.

54
04:44.760 --> 04:48.840
And that will override the center text-align in the body.

55
04:49.410 --> 04:55.440
So now if we hit refresh, you can see that our text inside the skill section is now left-aligned

56
04:55.710 --> 04:58.650
but outside of it, it's still center-aligned.

57
04:58.980 --> 05:05.010
Now, the next thing I want to do is to make the paragraphs, the text in here, a little bit more spaced

58
05:05.020 --> 05:07.680
apart by changing the line height.

59
05:08.130 --> 05:14.880
So can you double the line height by changing the line-height property? So pause the video and complete

60
05:14.880 --> 05:15.510
the challenge?

61
05:18.120 --> 05:23.370
All right, so in this case, we're again going to be inside the skill row and we're changing the line-

62
05:23.370 --> 05:30.030
height property to 2, and remember, in this case, we don't actually have any units and we're simply

63
05:30.030 --> 05:31.440
specifying a scale.

64
05:32.670 --> 05:38.430
Let's hit refresh and you can see that our text is now a lot more spaced out and much easier to read.

65
05:38.700 --> 05:44.970
Now, the last thing I want to do before we look into the positioning of our skill row is we need this

66
05:44.970 --> 05:46.740
image to be a lot smaller.

67
05:46.890 --> 05:52.230
So go ahead and change the width of the image to 25%.

68
05:57.360 --> 06:01.770
All right, so in order to target the image, we need to specify their class names.

69
06:01.800 --> 06:05.700
So one is called code-img and one is called chilli-img.

70
06:05.730 --> 06:10.470
Now this is just the classes that I've added for my own images.

71
06:10.710 --> 06:14.760
You might have name these classes differently because you might have different images.

72
06:15.150 --> 06:20.490
Just check what you have as your class name before you start implementing this and make sure that it

73
06:20.490 --> 06:20.910
works.

74
06:21.270 --> 06:27.780
So I'm going to cluster that with the other images, and the first one is called code-img, and I

75
06:27.780 --> 06:31.230
want to change the width to 25% of its parent.

76
06:31.830 --> 06:35.290
And the next one is the chilli-img

77
06:35.790 --> 06:40.230
and this, again, is going to have a width of 25%.

78
06:40.650 --> 06:42.960
Let's hit save and let's refresh.

79
06:42.990 --> 06:48.510
And you can see that they are now the same size, even though they weren't before because they're

80
06:48.510 --> 06:54.990
now scaled down based on the width of their parent, which in this case is actually the skill row.

81
06:55.290 --> 07:02.220
So it's now a quarter the width of the skill route, which itself is only 50% the width of the

82
07:02.220 --> 07:03.000
entire page.

83
07:03.270 --> 07:06.030
So now comes the really interesting thing.

84
07:06.270 --> 07:10.590
How can I make my text wrap around my image?

85
07:10.950 --> 07:16.560
So I want this skill row to be a lot stouter, so less in height,

86
07:16.710 --> 07:23.430
and I want this image to be on the left, but I want my text to be on the right of the image and wrapping

87
07:23.430 --> 07:25.560
around the image as necessary.

88
07:26.010 --> 07:32.220
Well, this is where the topic of this lesson comes in, and that is, of course, floating.

89
07:33.540 --> 07:42.000
So we can make the image float to the left of the text and make the text wrap around it by simply changing

90
07:42.000 --> 07:43.020
one property.

91
07:43.380 --> 07:45.420
And that is the float property.

92
07:45.660 --> 07:54.930
So if we go into our code image and we change the float property to float: left and we hit save, once

93
07:54.930 --> 08:03.330
we refresh, you'll see that our image is now on the left of our skill row and our text is now wrapping

94
08:03.330 --> 08:09.960
around the image in order to display both of these on the same line.

95
08:10.110 --> 08:14.340
Now it looks a little bit odd having the text right up next to the image.

96
08:14.760 --> 08:21.930
So can you figure out a way of having 30px of space between this text and this image?

97
08:22.380 --> 08:25.620
So pause the video and see if you can complete the challenge.

98
08:27.540 --> 08:29.770
Now, there's a couple of ways that you can do this.

99
08:29.790 --> 08:36.720
You can think about padding or margin. In this case in order to apply a margin to the text

100
08:36.750 --> 08:40.980
it would be kind of difficult because they're completely separate at the moment.

101
08:40.980 --> 08:43.230
We've got an h3 and we've got a paragraph.

102
08:43.620 --> 08:49.500
Now you could add a div to wrap them together and add a left margin to that div.

103
08:49.920 --> 08:54.750
But what's much easier is to simply add a margin-right to our image.

104
08:55.380 --> 09:05.130
So let's head into our code and change the code-img margin-right property to 30px.

105
09:06.300 --> 09:13.320
And once we refresh, you'll see that our image now has a bit of space between it and the text, and the

106
09:13.320 --> 09:15.450
text because it's wrapping around

107
09:15.750 --> 09:18.870
and now it has less width to be displayed

108
09:18.870 --> 09:26.220
it's actually taking up the full width of that div, and this looks a lot better than previously.

109
09:26.820 --> 09:34.410
Now, as a challenge, I want you to use the same principles of floating to make this image appear on

110
09:34.410 --> 09:42.110
the right over here and for the text to wrap around that image and to have the same amounts of 30px

111
09:42.130 --> 09:44.670
space between the image and the text.

112
09:44.970 --> 09:48.960
So pause the video now and see if you can complete this challenge.

113
09:50.190 --> 09:56.430
All right, so pretty much the same principles here, but in this case, we're not floating left anymore

114
09:56.460 --> 09:59.490
because we want it to be on the right of the text.

115
09:59.670 --> 10:05.320
So in that case, we have to change the float property to right instead of left.

116
10:05.760 --> 10:09.570
And that will mean that the text will wrap around the image on the left.

117
10:10.140 --> 10:18.090
And then we just have to add in that margin-left of 30px on the image in order to get it to have

118
10:18.090 --> 10:20.700
the same amount of space as we had up here.

119
10:21.450 --> 10:29.490
So this is looking pretty sweet and we're getting very, very close to our end result that we're looking

120
10:29.490 --> 10:29.790
for.

121
10:30.030 --> 10:35.910
Now, sometimes when you float an element, you might not want all of the text to be wrapped around

122
10:35.910 --> 10:36.090
it.

123
10:36.480 --> 10:44.400
So, for example, say, if we only wanted that title to wrap around this image and to be on the right

124
10:44.400 --> 10:51.900
of the image, then we can actually use another property to make sure that this text does not wrap and

125
10:51.900 --> 10:57.570
end up at the bottom over here below the image, and that property is called clear.

126
10:58.020 --> 11:02.130
So if I target the paragraph here, let's give it a class.

127
11:02.130 --> 11:11.730
Let's call it maybe code-skill-description, and I'm just going to copy and paste it down here.

128
11:12.950 --> 11:21.350
And if I use the clear property to clear its left side, then that prevents it from wrapping anything

129
11:21.350 --> 11:22.220
on the left.

130
11:22.880 --> 11:28.600
So let's go ahead and try that clear: left, hit save, refresh.

131
11:28.910 --> 11:35.510
You can see that that paragraph is now pushed to below the image, which is floating. But that heading,

132
11:35.510 --> 11:40.130
that H3, is still wrapping around the image that's floated to the left.

133
11:40.520 --> 11:46.370
If you think about clear as almost like the anti-float, then that starts to make a little bit more

134
11:46.370 --> 11:46.700
sense.

135
11:47.120 --> 11:52.970
So we're saying that float this image to the left and all text will wrap around it on the right.

136
11:53.360 --> 12:00.530
But for this paragraph, we said to clear its left, which means make sure that that left margin is

137
12:00.530 --> 12:07.610
clear and not wrapped around anything, then that basically prevents it from carrying out the default

138
12:07.610 --> 12:08.180
behavior.

139
12:08.420 --> 12:15.890
Now, as a challenge, can you make this paragraph appear below this image rather than wrapped around

140
12:15.890 --> 12:16.040
it?

141
12:16.580 --> 12:19.970
Pause the video and see if you can complete this challenge.

142
12:21.630 --> 12:24.390
All right, so it's exactly the same concept here.

143
12:24.480 --> 12:28.350
Now let's go ahead and just give that paragraph a class.

144
12:28.710 --> 12:33.300
Let's call this chilli-skill-description.

145
12:33.630 --> 12:35.950
And again, I'm going to copy it,

146
12:36.150 --> 12:39.690
save the file and paste it down here.

147
12:40.800 --> 12:45.240
And of course, remember that dot in front because it's a class.

148
12:45.690 --> 12:51.840
And in this case, I still need to use clear, but I have to clear its right side in order to make sure

149
12:51.840 --> 12:53.490
it doesn't wrap around the image.

150
12:53.790 --> 12:59.550
Because you can see that if I tried the same thing and I cleared its left side, nothing changes because

151
12:59.550 --> 13:01.650
it's not wrapping anything on its left.

152
13:02.100 --> 13:10.140
But if I change this to right, then you'll see that it now appears below the image and it's prevented

153
13:10.260 --> 13:13.920
from wrapping the image that's floated to the right.

154
13:14.460 --> 13:22.950
Now I'm actually going to go ahead and clear both of these CSS rules because I actually prefer

155
13:22.950 --> 13:27.900
the look that we had previously, and I'm going to get rid of these classes as well.

156
13:29.450 --> 13:37.580
And this is the final result that we want to keep. Now, as they say, with great power comes great responsibility.

157
13:38.060 --> 13:42.890
Float is one of the most commonly used and abused CSS properties.

158
13:43.280 --> 13:47.060
The thing to remember is that it has a whole bunch of corner cases.

159
13:47.480 --> 13:57.530
And I recommend to only use float when really, really necessary and only use it for what it's meant,

160
13:57.650 --> 14:03.620
which is wrapping text around a certain element and don't use it for positioning.

161
14:03.950 --> 14:10.730
Instead, use what we learned about positioning like relative or absolute positioning or using the margin and

162
14:10.760 --> 14:16.640
the padding for the layout and the positioning of your website, and to leave the float property only

163
14:16.640 --> 14:18.650
for the cases of wrapping text.

164
14:18.920 --> 14:26.180
Then you will surely get into less trouble and less problems than if you try to use float just as

165
14:26.180 --> 14:33.470
a sort of free-for-all layout property, which you see a lot of people mistakenly do. Now

166
14:33.470 --> 14:39.290
looking through the Q&As, one of the issues that students often have is that their design is not being

167
14:39.290 --> 14:40.310
laid out correctly

168
14:40.580 --> 14:46.460
like what you see onscreen and one of the most common reasons is because they're using different text.

169
14:46.820 --> 14:49.970
More specifically, a different length of text.

170
14:49.970 --> 14:56.330
So here you can see there's quite a lot of text, and based on that, our CSS styling is making it

171
14:56.330 --> 14:57.230
appear like this.

172
14:57.500 --> 15:03.110
But if you had only one sentence or only a few words, then you might see the images being slightly

173
15:03.110 --> 15:03.800
out of place.

174
15:04.340 --> 15:09.740
Further, if you display this on a larger screen size, or if you actually just grab the corner of your

175
15:09.740 --> 15:15.500
browser and you toggle it around, you'll see that as you shrink or expand the browser, your design

176
15:15.500 --> 15:20.150
is going to break and it's not going to look like it should, as you see here.

177
15:20.810 --> 15:25.220
Now, the reason for this is because our website is not yet responsive.

178
15:25.670 --> 15:30.500
And I'm saying not yet, because in the coming lessons when we learn about Bootstrap,

179
15:30.980 --> 15:35.840
when we learn about more advanced CSS, then we're going to be able to fix this problem and make our

180
15:35.840 --> 15:41.630
designs look the way we want it to in all screen sizes and in all dimensions.

181
15:41.900 --> 15:46.010
So don't worry too much about that if you're having trouble fixing the layout.

182
15:46.280 --> 15:53.210
Just try to make sure that you're using the same content for your index.html as we have here in

183
15:53.210 --> 15:58.820
the lessons, and try to make sure that you've got your CSS code matching and it should look right

184
15:58.820 --> 16:02.330
on most screen sizes, only to toggle it a little bit.

185
16:02.900 --> 16:11.390
So we are really, really close to the end of this module, and in the next section, I've got a challenge

186
16:11.420 --> 16:18.530
for you to look at a specification of how we want the website to be finally laid out.

187
16:18.920 --> 16:23.840
And instead of me guiding you step by step through all the little properties that you need to change,

188
16:24.140 --> 16:30.410
I want you to figure out what you need to change in order to achieve the layout that I've specified.

189
16:30.710 --> 16:37.550
So in the next lesson, you'll see text instructions for you to complete the final big challenge and

190
16:37.550 --> 16:39.680
get this website looking beautiful.

191
16:40.040 --> 16:43.100
So for all of that, I will see you on the next lesson.
