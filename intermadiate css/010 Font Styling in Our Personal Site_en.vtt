00:00.660 --> 00:06.090
Now, one of the most important decisions that you will have to make when you're designing your website

1
00:06.360 --> 00:08.640
is what are the fonts that you're going to choose?

2
00:09.090 --> 00:16.380
And a lot of web designers will start off by figuring out a color palette as well as a font scheme.

3
00:17.340 --> 00:23.760
So in this lesson, we're going to learn about how we can change the fonts for all of our text in our

4
00:23.760 --> 00:24.270
website.

5
00:25.560 --> 00:32.430
Now there are two major font families, and that is the serif and the sans serif fonts.

6
00:32.880 --> 00:40.410
So you can tell serif and sans serif fonts apart from each other by looking for these little feet at

7
00:40.410 --> 00:46.250
the edges of all of the letters, and these little feet are called serifs.

8
00:46.290 --> 00:54.510
Now we can broadly define whether if we want a sans-serif or a serif typeface for any text on our website.

9
00:55.230 --> 01:02.970
So let's go ahead and do that. If we go into our stylesheet and we change the font family

10
01:04.210 --> 01:12.430
property for our body, then we actually affect all the text on our web page. And you can see that there's

11
01:12.520 --> 01:15.340
five major families listed here

12
01:15.760 --> 01:19.180
now only three of which are you actually going to use.

13
01:19.810 --> 01:22.600
So we've seen serif and sans serif.

14
01:23.230 --> 01:30.290
Now, monospace is when each of the characters inside the text take up the same amount of width.

15
01:30.520 --> 01:35.800
And that's usually a typeface that we use for coding because it makes everything super easy to read.

16
01:36.190 --> 01:43.600
For example, if this word align was styled in a serif or sans serif typeface, then the 'i' would

17
01:43.600 --> 01:46.240
be squished right next to the 'L' and the 'g'.

18
01:46.750 --> 01:54.460
But because all code is represented in a monospaced font, then you can more easily read each of the

19
01:54.460 --> 01:58.390
letters. So you'll use these to your normal website styling.

20
01:58.720 --> 02:04.000
And when you do have code on your web page, sometimes people like to style it using monospace.

21
02:04.720 --> 02:09.820
Now, cursive and fantasy are two families that you're never really going to use.

22
02:10.420 --> 02:16.660
Firstly, because they have low readability, and secondly, because they generally don't look that

23
02:16.660 --> 02:19.270
great when used in the body of a website.

24
02:19.930 --> 02:22.810
So cursive is meant to be handwritten

25
02:22.810 --> 02:28.480
style of fonts and fantasy is meant to remind you of Avatar, basically.

26
02:29.850 --> 02:34.410
So let's take a look at what each of these families look like.

27
02:34.680 --> 02:42.390
So let's first define a font family of serif, and let's head back over to our website and we hit refresh.

28
02:42.420 --> 02:45.300
You'll notice that nothing happens. By default

29
02:45.310 --> 02:47.370
we already have a serif family.

30
02:47.430 --> 02:51.960
You can see that at the end of the Is, we've already got these little feet.

31
02:53.070 --> 02:58.980
Now, if we change that to sans-serif, however, we will get a noticeable change.

32
02:59.250 --> 03:05.160
And those little feet or those little serifs now disappear, and we have a different style. Now

33
03:05.160 --> 03:11.280
for most browsers, the default serif is the Times font, and the default sans serif is Arial.

34
03:11.460 --> 03:13.560
And this is the Arial font.

35
03:13.590 --> 03:19.470
Now, if we changed this to fantasy, then it will still work,

36
03:19.650 --> 03:23.310
it just now looks like I'm producing the next avatar.

37
03:23.730 --> 03:27.180
So let's head back to a sans serif typeface.

38
03:27.750 --> 03:32.430
And I'm not really satisfied with just an Arial font.

39
03:32.460 --> 03:35.110
What if I want a different sans serif font?

40
03:35.340 --> 03:40.680
Let's say that instead of Arial, I would rather have Verdana as the font for my website.

41
03:41.040 --> 03:49.890
Now what I can do is instead of specifying just the sans serif broad stroke family, I can add a specific

42
03:49.890 --> 03:51.900
font or typeface in front.

43
03:52.440 --> 04:00.840
For example, if I wanted the Verdana font, then I can simply type verdana and then have a comma and

44
04:00.840 --> 04:05.190
then separate that from the sans serif family.

45
04:05.700 --> 04:11.730
And now, if we head back over here and refresh, you can see I'm now using the Verdana font.

46
04:12.300 --> 04:18.240
And what this line of code does is that it sets the font family for all the text inside the body,

47
04:18.840 --> 04:24.960
but it first asks the browser to try and render all the text in the Verdana font.

48
04:25.560 --> 04:31.950
Now, if for some reason the browser or the operating system that the user's using doesn't have this

49
04:31.950 --> 04:38.220
font installed, then it will default to whatever is the sans serif font that is installed on their

50
04:38.220 --> 04:38.790
system.

51
04:39.240 --> 04:44.730
Now that's a little bit scary, because that kind of means that I might think that I've designed my

52
04:44.730 --> 04:48.780
website to look like this, and I think it looks perfect just like this.

53
04:49.080 --> 04:56.190
But on somebody else's system or browser, they might be getting a completely different style with different

54
04:56.190 --> 04:59.670
font heights and just a different look and feel.

55
05:00.420 --> 05:03.870
So there is such a thing called web safe fonts.

56
05:04.950 --> 05:13.470
Now what this means is that there's a set of font families where most operating systems will be able

57
05:13.470 --> 05:15.360
to render it correctly.

58
05:15.870 --> 05:22.830
And for the serifs that includes Georgia, Times New Roman; for the sans serif that includes Arial, Comic

59
05:22.830 --> 05:29.640
Sans, Impact, etc. Although these are called web safe fonts, and it's basically saying that if you

60
05:29.640 --> 05:37.380
choose these sets of fonts, then you have the maximum chance of getting it rendered correctly as you're

61
05:37.380 --> 05:39.990
seeing yourself when you're designing it.

62
05:40.410 --> 05:50.310
But actually, no font is 100% web safe. And if you head over to cssfontstack.com, then somebody

63
05:50.310 --> 05:55.500
has actually painstakingly listed all of the fonts that are in common usage

64
05:55.920 --> 06:02.190
and what is the percentage of users who have installed, separated by their operating system.

65
06:02.640 --> 06:06.990
So as you can see, the font that most people have is Arial.

66
06:06.990 --> 06:12.900
So 99.8% installation on Windows, 98.7% on the Mac.

67
06:13.500 --> 06:15.470
Now that is really, really high.

68
06:15.780 --> 06:22.380
But for some other fonts, you'll see a difference between the Mac and the Windows operating systems,

69
06:22.680 --> 06:25.230
and we're not even including Linux users here.

70
06:25.500 --> 06:31.440
So, for example, if you look at something like Helvetica, which is a Apple-specific thing, then

71
06:31.440 --> 06:34.290
on Windows installation rate is really, really low.

72
06:34.740 --> 06:40.780
And on Mac, it's 100% because it comes pre-installed with all Mac OS.

73
06:40.800 --> 06:48.570
So what can you do if you want to use a font, but you're not sure if everyone has it installed, right?

74
06:48.900 --> 06:54.630
For example, if I want to use Helvetica, then there's only 7% of users on Windows who are

75
06:54.630 --> 06:57.840
going to see it rendered in that font.

76
06:58.080 --> 07:00.510
Well, then you would need fallbacks.

77
07:00.930 --> 07:08.520
So if we click on this little icon here on fontstack, then we actually copy a set of fallbacks for

78
07:08.520 --> 07:09.660
this Helvetica font.

79
07:10.230 --> 07:20.220
And if I go ahead and paste that and replace our font family, then you can see that we have a stack

80
07:20.220 --> 07:21.120
of fallbacks.

81
07:21.510 --> 07:28.890
So I'm basically saying that I want the font family to be Helvetica Neue if they have it. And if they

82
07:28.890 --> 07:33.300
have an Apple system, that's very likely that they will have this font installed.

83
07:33.900 --> 07:38.820
If they don't have it, then default to the next best thing, which is Helvetica,

84
07:39.270 --> 07:42.600
and if they don't have that, then default to Arial.

85
07:42.780 --> 07:46.290
And finally, just go with whatever sans serif they've got installed

86
07:46.290 --> 07:51.810
if they don't even have Arial, which is very unlikely, but you can see how we're going from specific

87
07:52.110 --> 07:52.530
to

88
07:52.620 --> 07:59.970
less specific and all the while ensuring that we're getting roughly a similar sort of typeface and similar

89
07:59.970 --> 08:05.370
sort of feel, no matter which font the user have installed or not installed.

90
08:06.300 --> 08:11.880
So if we hit save and we go back to our website, then you can see that on the Mac,

91
08:12.120 --> 08:14.490
I do indeed have Helvetica Neue installed

92
08:14.870 --> 08:17.970
and that's what's currently being rendered on screen.

93
08:18.090 --> 08:22.360
But say, if I was on Windows, then I might be seeing Arial in this case.

94
08:22.380 --> 08:28.050
And you can go ahead and give it a go and have a look at these font stacks and copy them over to your

95
08:28.050 --> 08:31.020
web page and see what you're able to get.

96
08:31.290 --> 08:36.040
Now, what if we were even more picky as designers?

97
08:36.060 --> 08:43.230
What if I really want everybody who looks at my website to see exactly the same thing as I designed

98
08:43.230 --> 08:43.400
it?

99
08:43.410 --> 08:49.440
I want them to see the design that I intended instead of whatever font it is that they happen to have

100
08:49.440 --> 08:50.100
installed.

101
08:50.850 --> 08:57.330
And for example, if I was using Helvetica, then pretty much like 93% of Windows users are just

102
08:57.330 --> 08:58.410
going to see Arial.

103
08:58.470 --> 08:59.970
What if I really hate Arial?

104
09:00.330 --> 09:08.550
What can I do to ensure that everybody has the same viewing experience with regards to the fonts on

105
09:08.550 --> 09:09.210
my website?

106
09:09.420 --> 09:12.780
Well, you could use something called a font embedding.

107
09:13.380 --> 09:20.640
So if we head over to fonts.google.com, then you can see that they've got a whole bunch of font

108
09:20.640 --> 09:23.100
families that you can choose from.

109
09:23.640 --> 09:31.590
And these are all fonts that are free for commercial use that you can simply embed into your website

110
09:31.650 --> 09:34.930
and there's a large choice of font families that you can pick through.

111
09:35.400 --> 09:41.340
So you can choose whether if you want just serif fonts to look through or sans serif.

112
09:41.550 --> 09:48.300
They have these cool articles about which fonts go well with which and a whole bunch of really, really

113
09:48.300 --> 09:49.500
useful stuff, actually.

114
09:49.800 --> 09:52.890
But in my case, I already know what it is that I want.

115
09:53.370 --> 09:56.510
I want the font called Merriweather.

116
09:57.420 --> 10:02.310
Now, before we search for that font here, we're going to make sure that if you did apply a filter

117
10:02.310 --> 10:07.950
like here that I have looking only for the sans serif in the fonts, then you make sure that you just

118
10:07.950 --> 10:13.700
click reset so that we can find all types of fonts and then we can search for Merriweather.

119
10:14.070 --> 10:17.490
And we actually want this one, not the sans serif type.

120
10:17.670 --> 10:18.000
That's.

121
10:18.810 --> 10:25.410
So let's go ahead and click on it, and then you can take a look at what it looks like. It's got who

122
10:25.410 --> 10:29.490
designed it, what the purpose of this typeface is,

123
10:29.820 --> 10:34.740
and you can also see how your sentence would look like if you decided to change the text.

124
10:35.430 --> 10:43.200
Now, while we here, we're going to go and find the regular 400 point size font, and then we're going

125
10:43.200 --> 10:49.650
to go ahead and click Plus to select the style and add it to our list of selections.

126
10:50.490 --> 10:56.760
Now I'm going to go ahead and add a few more different fonts before I show you how we're going to incorporate

127
10:56.760 --> 10:57.060
this.

128
10:57.450 --> 11:00.660
So the other one that I'm going to pick up is a handwriting font

129
11:00.660 --> 11:06.090
actually, it's called Sacramento. And this I'm going to use as the font for my H1.

130
11:06.450 --> 11:12.000
So a very stylish sort of font where we don't really need people to read it that clearly.

131
11:12.450 --> 11:17.490
So it's not like a body font where it would be quite painful to try and read through, you know, 300

132
11:17.490 --> 11:18.990
words are all styled like this.

133
11:19.530 --> 11:21.260
So let's go ahead and add that too.

134
11:21.270 --> 11:23.070
So we've got now two selected.

135
11:23.580 --> 11:30.780
And the last thing that I want is my main heading font and that is going to be a sans serif.

136
11:31.170 --> 11:35.100
And one that I'm quite partial to is the Monserrat.

137
11:35.250 --> 11:36.960
So I'm going to go ahead and add that as well.

138
11:37.380 --> 11:46.140
So now I've got three font families selected and I can embed it into my website as easily as copying this

139
11:46.140 --> 11:51.180
link and pasting that at the top of my index.html.

140
11:51.540 --> 11:53.290
Just going to paste that link in there.

141
11:53.700 --> 12:02.430
And this specifies a location where if users don't have these fonts already installed or cached on their

142
12:02.430 --> 12:09.120
system, then the browser will take them to this location and grab those fonts for them.

143
12:09.930 --> 12:16.320
And then if we go into the style.css, then I can specify a font family that I want to use.

144
12:16.890 --> 12:24.870
So the one that I want for my body is the Merriweather font, and I'm going to place that in here and

145
12:24.870 --> 12:30.030
it will default to serif if something terrible happens, say the internet connection went down in the

146
12:30.030 --> 12:35.280
middle of downloading the font, etc. But you can see it's not a large font stack because in pretty

147
12:35.280 --> 12:40.170
99.9999% of the time, this is the font that everybody is going

148
12:40.170 --> 12:45.900
to see because we are embedding it instead of presuming that people already have it.

149
12:47.070 --> 12:52.470
Now, for my h1, I'm going to use the Sacramento and for my

150
12:52.620 --> 12:55.650
H2 and also H3s

151
12:56.160 --> 12:58.720
I'm going to use the Monserrat.

152
13:00.090 --> 13:06.400
So let's go ahead and put those in there and just hit beautify to rearrange everything.

153
13:07.150 --> 13:11.310
Let's hit, save, take ourselves, back over to our site,

154
13:11.610 --> 13:13.830
hit refresh and voila.

155
13:13.980 --> 13:21.480
Our text is now beautifully styled using the fonts that we chose from Google fonts. So feel free to

156
13:21.480 --> 13:27.000
have a mess around with the different fonts that you might like or you might want to incorporate into

157
13:27.000 --> 13:30.630
your website and then simply add them to your selection.

158
13:30.990 --> 13:38.640
Include the link in your index.html and start using them in your CSS like

159
13:38.640 --> 13:45.420
so. Now in the next lesson, I want to go and do a deep dive on different fonts and different typefaces.

160
13:45.780 --> 13:49.110
What are the different families and how they came about?

161
13:49.200 --> 13:56.460
So just a lesson on one of the most crucial parts of digital design, and that's of course, typography.

162
13:56.820 --> 14:00.780
So if you're interested, then that is what you will get on the next lesson.

163
14:01.230 --> 14:06.730
If you're not interested, then you can feel free and go ahead and skip ahead to the next lesson

164
14:06.750 --> 14:13.500
where we explore some of the other font and text properties that we can use to style our text on our

165
14:13.500 --> 14:16.170
website, so I'll see you on the next lesson.
