00:00.420 --> 00:04.950
Now, let's structure our form so that it looks like a proper contact form.

1
00:05.460 --> 00:09.900
So let's again add a horizontal rule to divide the top half from the bottom.

2
00:10.500 --> 00:15.100
And then in our form, we want a label that says Your Name,

3
00:15.120 --> 00:18.200
and then after that, we're going to get rid of this color.

4
00:18.810 --> 00:20.630
But we do want that line break.

5
00:20.640 --> 00:22.900
And then we've got a label that says Password,

6
00:22.920 --> 00:25.680
maybe we should ask them for Your Email.

7
00:26.190 --> 00:28.530
Maybe that'll help us get back in touch with them.

8
00:29.250 --> 00:34.110
And instead of password input type, we're going to change that to email.

9
00:34.470 --> 00:38.580
And to do that, I have to use something that's not actually an input.

10
00:38.850 --> 00:42.300
Instead, it's an HTML element called text area.

11
00:42.510 --> 00:51.690
So let's add a label first, and let's say "Your Message." And text area has two attributes that are really

12
00:51.690 --> 00:52.290
important.

13
00:52.770 --> 00:56.040
One is the number of rows and the other one is the number of columns.

14
00:56.400 --> 01:01.500
So rows determine how tall your text area should be,

15
01:01.920 --> 01:05.520
and columns determine how wide it should be on your web page.

16
01:06.940 --> 01:12.080
I'm going to stick to maybe 10 rows and 30 columns.

17
01:12.580 --> 01:18.160
But if we hit Save, you'll see that it's actually something that you can modify.

18
01:18.490 --> 01:22.930
And I'm sure you've seen these text fields all over the internet. Anywhere where you have to put in

19
01:22.930 --> 01:23.800
a long answer

20
01:24.070 --> 01:27.910
you'll get something that looks like a box and you've got these few lines in the right corner.

21
01:28.240 --> 01:33.850
And what you can do is you can click and drag it to make that text field as large or as small as you

22
01:33.850 --> 01:34.540
want it to be.

23
01:34.990 --> 01:39.430
But the default or the starting position is defined by the developer.

24
01:40.900 --> 01:42.230
It's looking a little bit messy.

25
01:42.250 --> 01:48.190
Let's add a few more line breaks so that we can space things out a little bit and make it look a little

26
01:48.190 --> 01:49.030
bit more appealing.

27
01:49.180 --> 01:51.190
All right, so that looks a little bit nicer.

28
01:51.220 --> 01:54.850
I know it's still very barebones, but at least it's starting to take shape.

29
01:55.390 --> 02:01.930
Now, the only problem is that at the moment, when you hit the submit button, what it does is that

30
02:01.930 --> 02:04.480
it'll take you back to your home page.

31
02:05.050 --> 02:11.250
And the reason is because when we created our form, it has this attribute called action,

32
02:11.260 --> 02:14.710
i.e what should happen when you click submit.

33
02:15.160 --> 02:20.920
And at the moment, the action is simply take the user to the index.html page.

34
02:21.220 --> 02:23.140
And that is, of course, our home page.

35
02:23.830 --> 02:26.560
Now, without knowing anything about CSC or JavaScript,

36
02:26.830 --> 02:32.290
we can't actually get very deep into understanding what the method or the action means, but you kind

37
02:32.290 --> 02:34.990
of want it to have some basic functionality, right?

38
02:35.230 --> 02:39.070
Because otherwise it doesn't make any sense to anybody who's going onto our website.

39
02:39.460 --> 02:45.160
And even though this is our first web site, it doesn't mean that it can't function well or do something

40
02:45.160 --> 02:46.000
very simple.

41
02:46.510 --> 02:51.820
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to change the form action to a mail to.

42
02:53.140 --> 02:59.710
And what mailtos do is that when you press the submit button, they'll open up your default mail client,

43
02:59.710 --> 03:01.720
so that could be mail on Mac

44
03:01.720 --> 03:09.730
or it might go into Gmail if you're inside Chrome. And it puts in the email address that you specify

45
03:09.760 --> 03:11.140
after the colon here.

46
03:11.350 --> 03:18.130
And the post in this case simply means that we're going to transfer what the user types into these input

47
03:18.130 --> 03:20.800
fields into the email client.

48
03:21.220 --> 03:24.070
If we hit Save, I'll show you what it looks like.

49
03:24.580 --> 03:31.030
So let's go to contact me and let's give my name, my email,

50
03:34.130 --> 03:35.390
and my message.

51
03:37.830 --> 03:45.350
Now, if I hit submit, you can see that it opens up my mail app and adds a little bit of text into

52
03:45.350 --> 03:46.730
the body of the email.

53
03:47.090 --> 03:52.910
Now if when you hit the submit button, you don't see any pop ups, you don't see a mail application

54
03:53.390 --> 03:58.230
or if nothing happens, then it could be that there might be an error in your code,

55
03:58.250 --> 03:59.450
so go back and check that.

56
03:59.750 --> 04:06.410
But more likely, it might be because you don't actually have a mail application installed on your computer.

57
04:07.100 --> 04:11.930
Now, if you're using a Mac, by default, it comes with the mail application.

58
04:12.440 --> 04:16.520
But if you are on Windows, you might actually not have a mail application installed.

59
04:17.150 --> 04:23.240
So if you don't want to install a separate mail application, then the best solution for this is to

60
04:23.240 --> 04:28.040
actually set Google Mail or Gmail as your default email application.

61
04:28.340 --> 04:31.010
Because let's face it, most of us have a Gmail account, right?

62
04:31.670 --> 04:33.440
So now I'm going to show you how to do that.

63
04:33.530 --> 04:40.070
So first, you need the Chrome browser open, and then you go to these three dots here and then go to

64
04:40.130 --> 04:40.850
Settings.

65
04:41.600 --> 04:47.270
Now here you're going to click on privacy and security and then go to site settings.

66
04:47.600 --> 04:52.520
Now, sometimes I've seen this called content settings, but it should have this little symbol, and

67
04:52.520 --> 04:56.300
if you click on it, it should take you to a page with the permissions.

68
04:56.840 --> 04:58.680
If you scroll to the bottom of the permissions,

69
04:58.730 --> 05:00.350
click on additional permissions,

70
05:00.650 --> 05:02.330
then you can go to the protocol

71
05:02.330 --> 05:08.000
handlers. Might also be called handlers. But keep an eye on this little icon.

72
05:08.390 --> 05:10.520
We're going to need to remember a little bit later on.

73
05:11.330 --> 05:17.930
Now, go to the protocol handlers and make sure that sites are allowed to handle protocols, so make

74
05:17.930 --> 05:22.070
sure this is selected. And if not, go ahead and click on it.

75
05:22.730 --> 05:27.710
And then we're going to have to make sure that in the section where it says "not allowed to handle protocols"

76
05:28.070 --> 05:31.010
that our mail.google.com is not here.

77
05:31.040 --> 05:35.000
So if it is like this, go ahead and click on the X to remove it.

78
05:35.540 --> 05:37.550
So now you have a Gmail tab open

79
05:37.850 --> 05:39.180
go ahead and close it down.

80
05:39.620 --> 05:43.070
And then we're going to go to a new tab and head over to gmail.com.

81
05:43.970 --> 05:47.080
So now when this loads up, you should see a little symbol here.

82
05:47.090 --> 05:47.870
Remember that symbol

83
05:47.870 --> 05:48.920
I asked you to remember?

84
05:49.430 --> 05:55.010
So if you click on it, it says, Do you allow mail.google.com to open or email links and you should

85
05:55.010 --> 05:57.500
click Allow and then click done.

86
05:58.340 --> 06:05.450
Now I found a site to test mailto links and you can, of course, use the website that you've created.

87
06:05.810 --> 06:12.140
If you click on the mailto link, it should take you to a new tab and it should pre-fill all the

88
06:12.140 --> 06:15.590
information that we want to, and it should work as expected.

89
06:16.400 --> 06:21.650
Now, alternatively, if you don't have a Gmail account or you don't want to use Gmail as your default

90
06:21.950 --> 06:27.380
email client, you can also install an email application which takes a bit longer.

91
06:27.590 --> 06:34.070
So in the Q&A section for this lesson, you can find text-based instructions for all I've just done, and

92
06:34.070 --> 06:36.890
you can find that in the featured questions section.

93
06:37.310 --> 06:39.890
So now that we've got this working, we can carry on.

94
06:40.550 --> 06:46.340
Now it's not making too much sense right now, and in order to change that, we actually have to add

95
06:46.340 --> 06:48.320
a little bit more to our form.

96
06:48.590 --> 06:55.700
So I'm going to delete this class and I'm going to add another attribute called encoding type.

97
06:56.090 --> 07:02.030
And this specifies just as up here, we're specifying that our website is encoded in UTF-8,

98
07:02.390 --> 07:07.190
we're going to say that the data in our form is encoded in plain text.

99
07:07.490 --> 07:12.800
So that way, when it launches the Mail app, you won't have these funny percentage signs and numbers.

100
07:13.100 --> 07:14.960
You'll instead just have plain text.

101
07:15.620 --> 07:21.950
Now, the other thing we need to add is a value to each of these name attributes, because that's going

102
07:21.950 --> 07:25.820
to identify the data that's inside each of these inputs.

103
07:26.300 --> 07:27.430
And I'll show you what I mean.

104
07:27.440 --> 07:30.530
So let's add the name as yourName,

105
07:31.370 --> 07:34.190
second, one yourEmail,

106
07:36.100 --> 07:38.800
and the third one

107
07:39.220 --> 07:40.600
yourMessage.

108
07:42.230 --> 07:49.590
All right, let's hit save, and let's go back to our website, hit refresh, and let's try it again.

109
07:49.970 --> 07:55.310
Now I didn't show you this last time, but the cool thing about the email text field that we added here

110
07:55.310 --> 08:00.020
by changing the input to email is that it does some basic validation.

111
08:00.020 --> 08:05.540
And that means if I type something like this and I try to hit enter now, it's a little bit different

112
08:05.540 --> 08:12.470
from browser to browser, but your browser might tell you that please include an @ sign in your email

113
08:12.470 --> 08:15.560
address because all email addresses have @ signs, right?

114
08:16.070 --> 08:19.400
And then it says please enter a part following the @ sign.

115
08:19.640 --> 08:21.680
All emails have something after the @ sign.

116
08:23.310 --> 08:29.640
And it says emails don't contain these weird symbols, so you're probably not entering a correct email

117
08:29.670 --> 08:30.960
or make sure that you check.

118
08:31.560 --> 08:33.240
So that's our email.

119
08:33.900 --> 08:38.190
But even though it's not a real email, it passes those basic validation checks.

120
08:38.490 --> 08:43.620
But we got all of those validation checks for free just by changing our inputtype to email.

121
08:43.890 --> 08:45.220
So it's a really pretty good deal.

122
08:45.270 --> 08:50.310
And later on, we'll show you how to make that validation a little bit more sophisticated, but it's

123
08:50.310 --> 08:54.300
really kind of cool that we have that. And then we'll add an email.

124
08:54.310 --> 08:58.170
So let's say, hey there again and now hit submit.

125
08:58.470 --> 09:03.960
And you can see now because we've added something to that name attribute

126
09:04.320 --> 09:10.410
where we said yourName, yourEmail, yourMessage, what we added here and here and here.

127
09:11.280 --> 09:21.300
Now, when we submit our form and we post this data that the users inputted to our mail client, then

128
09:21.300 --> 09:28.260
it knows how to classify each bit of the data, i.e. this input should be labelled your name,

129
09:28.470 --> 09:33.030
this input should be labelled your email and your message should be labelled like so.

130
09:33.350 --> 09:39.540
So this is a really, really basic little bit of functionality that we can get without yet understanding

131
09:39.540 --> 09:41.100
about JavaScript.

132
09:41.580 --> 09:48.060
So once you get to the JavaScript module, we're going to come back and revisit forms and we're going

133
09:48.060 --> 09:51.180
to unleash the full power of HTML forms.

134
09:52.080 --> 09:58.260
But for now, this is a neat little bit of functionality that when we publish our website, it'll still

135
09:58.260 --> 10:04.920
work well enough for anybody who's actually coming onto our personal website or personal page.

136
10:06.010 --> 10:10.930
Now, in the next lesson, we're going to be launching into our intermediate HTML challenge.

137
10:11.260 --> 10:16.210
So we're going to be getting you to recreate a webpage using all of the things that you've learned in

138
10:16.210 --> 10:16.870
this module.

139
10:17.320 --> 10:20.200
So for all of that and more, I'll see you on the next lesson.
