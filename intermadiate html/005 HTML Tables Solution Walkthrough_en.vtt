00:00.420 --> 00:02.400
All right. So how did that go?

1
00:02.940 --> 00:05.610
The first thing that we have to do is, of course,

2
00:05.730 --> 00:10.470
add our h3 and we're going to do that right above the horizontal rule,

3
00:10.800 --> 00:15.450
which is here and below our table. So right here.

4
00:16.680 --> 00:20.070
And we're going to create something that's called skills,

5
00:20.970 --> 00:23.940
and then we need to make a new table.

6
00:24.870 --> 00:29.280
And this table is not going to have any headings because we don't have any

7
00:29.280 --> 00:33.900
headings over here, but it is going to have some rows and some columns.

8
00:34.380 --> 00:39.380
So let's make our first row using tr and let's list our first skill inside

9
00:40.050 --> 00:43.890
a td. And let's say, uh,

10
00:43.920 --> 00:45.900
iOS development.

11
00:46.800 --> 00:50.370
And then we can put our stars in a second td

12
00:50.460 --> 00:55.460
that's going to be right next to our first td in our second column.

13
00:56.430 --> 01:01.430
And we're going to pull up the emoji inspector and we're just gonna add in a

14
01:02.160 --> 01:05.970
star which I'm going to copy and paste.

15
01:06.510 --> 01:11.160
And now to save time, I'm just going to copy the row. Now,

16
01:11.160 --> 01:14.670
whenever you're Programming and you find yourself doing a lot of copying and

17
01:14.670 --> 01:19.200
pasting, then you're probably doing something wrong. Now,

18
01:19.200 --> 01:22.260
in order to save time, you'll see me do it quite a lot

19
01:22.560 --> 01:26.490
and it's because it's not very fun for you to watch me writing tr and td all

20
01:26.490 --> 01:29.460
day long. But when you're coding yourself,

21
01:29.730 --> 01:32.310
ideally, try and avoid copying and pasting.

22
01:32.400 --> 01:35.820
And when you do, always make sure that you understand what you're copying and

23
01:35.820 --> 01:36.600
pasting,

24
01:36.600 --> 01:40.800
and also make sure you check for any bugs and errors that you introduce.

25
01:40.920 --> 01:43.560
So let's edit some of these things.

26
01:47.270 --> 01:52.220
All right, cool. Let's hit save and let's check it out. Looks pretty neat,

27
01:52.220 --> 01:56.540
right? All right. So now let's tackle bonus points.

28
01:56.930 --> 02:01.100
If you've given it a go and you've managed to do it, then really well done.

29
02:01.310 --> 02:05.210
It takes a little bit of researching around and a little bit of lateral thinking

30
02:05.240 --> 02:06.620
in order to get it working.

31
02:06.860 --> 02:11.480
But if you haven't or if you want to find out how one might do it, then take a

32
02:11.480 --> 02:15.080
look now. Essentially what we're trying to achieve here

33
02:15.080 --> 02:17.990
is very similar to what we've done at the top.

34
02:18.170 --> 02:21.500
We're trying to affect the layout by using tables.

35
02:21.830 --> 02:26.830
So essentially what we want is a table that has two columns or two table

36
02:29.060 --> 02:33.470
data cells and in each cell we have a separate table

37
02:33.650 --> 02:37.340
which itself has two rows and two columns.

38
02:37.490 --> 02:42.020
So the solution is essentially going to be a nested table.

39
02:42.890 --> 02:45.770
I'm going to make a little bit of space after the h3

40
02:46.220 --> 02:51.020
and I'm going to create essentially the same structure as we've got up here,

41
02:51.290 --> 02:56.090
a new table that has a single row and two table data cells,

42
02:56.900 --> 03:00.430
this one, and this one. Down here,

43
03:00.430 --> 03:01.960
I'm going to create a brand new table.

44
03:02.650 --> 03:05.890
And then I'm going to create a tr or a table row.

45
03:06.310 --> 03:08.590
And I'm going to create two table cells.

46
03:11.200 --> 03:15.190
Now, inside that first table data cell,

47
03:15.730 --> 03:18.250
I'm going to place our existing table.

48
03:18.310 --> 03:21.490
So I'm going to cut it and then I'm going to paste it in here.

49
03:22.660 --> 03:26.230
And then I'm going to grab another copy of this table

50
03:26.590 --> 03:31.590
and then I'm going to paste it into the second table data cell of the first

51
03:32.200 --> 03:36.880
level table. So right over here. Now,

52
03:36.910 --> 03:39.340
the structure is a little bit confusing,

53
03:39.430 --> 03:44.430
and this is one of the reasons why using HTML to affect the layout is not a

54
03:44.920 --> 03:48.430
great idea. But, by doing this exercise,

55
03:48.490 --> 03:52.810
you do get to grips with using tables, table rows, table datas.

56
03:53.230 --> 03:55.300
And if you've managed to complete this challenge,

57
03:55.330 --> 04:00.330
then you should understand the ins and outs of how to create tables using HTML.

58
04:01.390 --> 04:05.890
So now if we hit save and let's take a look at our work,

59
04:06.700 --> 04:11.700
you can see that we've got a single table with two tables nested inside,

60
04:13.150 --> 04:17.290
and we've managed to achieve this kind of structure. Now,

61
04:17.290 --> 04:21.580
feel free to keep this layout or revert to the previous layout before the bonus

62
04:21.580 --> 04:24.670
challenge. It's completely up to you, or even design it

63
04:24.670 --> 04:27.370
however you like with as many tables as you need.

64
04:27.490 --> 04:31.180
But I'm going to get rid of this nested table because it makes it really,

65
04:31.180 --> 04:34.780
really complicated to see at a glance what's going on.

66
04:34.930 --> 04:39.930
So I'm going to remove this top-level table and everything below this closing

67
04:40.510 --> 04:42.760
table tag, I'm going to delete.

68
04:43.240 --> 04:45.640
And I'm going to get rid of some of that space.

69
04:46.150 --> 04:49.120
And we're back at where we were before the challenge

70
04:49.210 --> 04:51.910
and I'll hit save to continue from here.

71
04:52.450 --> 04:57.450
Let's finish off by just giving our tables a little bit more spacing so that

72
04:57.520 --> 04:59.530
everything looks a little bit more spread out.

73
04:59.770 --> 05:04.210
So go ahead and add the cell spacing attribute to both of your tables and give

74
05:04.210 --> 05:06.130
it a value of say 10 pixels.

75
05:10.380 --> 05:13.050
All right. So that's easy enough. We've done it before here.

76
05:13.140 --> 05:18.140
So we're going to add cell spacing equals 10 up here and also in this table as

77
05:22.110 --> 05:27.060
well. Hit save. Let's check it out. Nice. It looks pretty good, right?

78
05:27.780 --> 05:31.230
And finally, let's add a few more horizontal rules.

79
05:31.560 --> 05:35.790
So let's add one between books and teaching and work experience and also one

80
05:35.790 --> 05:38.010
between work experience and skills.

81
05:42.330 --> 05:42.750
Okay.

82
05:42.750 --> 05:47.750
So let's find the end of books and teaching and let's add a horizontal rule here.

83
05:48.960 --> 05:53.960
Let's find the end of work experience and let's add a horizontal rule here.

84
05:56.610 --> 06:00.710
Hit save, refresh. There we go. A bit more spacing,

85
06:00.950 --> 06:03.500
everything looks a little bit more padded out. Alright.

86
06:03.560 --> 06:06.170
So if any of that was confusing or difficult,

87
06:06.440 --> 06:11.240
make sure that you watch the video again and also have a read of the MDN web

88
06:11.240 --> 06:13.130
docs on not just tables,

89
06:13.430 --> 06:18.430
but also thead or tbody or tfoot or th, th, et cetera.

90
06:20.210 --> 06:23.870
So that you can have a look at the example code and see some other examples of

91
06:23.870 --> 06:27.620
how you can use tables and rows and cells.

92
06:28.490 --> 06:29.570
Now in the next lesson,

93
06:29.600 --> 06:34.600
we're going to learn all about HTML forms and how you can add these to your

94
06:35.240 --> 06:38.300
webpage to collect data from your users.

95
06:38.870 --> 06:42.170
So all of that and more see you on the next lesson.
