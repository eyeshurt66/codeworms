00:00.120 --> 00:05.120
So now that we've got books and teaching or education and work experience listed

1
00:05.400 --> 00:06.720
in chronological order,

2
00:06.960 --> 00:11.490
the next thing that might be nice to add are listing some of the skills that you

3
00:11.490 --> 00:12.300
have.

4
00:12.300 --> 00:17.300
So I want you, as a challenge, to create a table where you've got an h3 for

5
00:18.960 --> 00:21.180
the skills subtitle,

6
00:21.660 --> 00:26.660
and then you've got all your skills listed in a column on the left, and on the

7
00:27.030 --> 00:27.630
right

8
00:27.630 --> 00:32.630
you've got some rows where you've listed using emojis to show how familiar you

9
00:33.900 --> 00:38.430
are with each skill ranging from 5 star to 1 star.

10
00:39.000 --> 00:40.050
Once you're done,

11
00:40.110 --> 00:44.040
you should have a website that looks something like this.

12
00:44.400 --> 00:47.010
So you've got your h3 as a subtitle,

13
00:47.400 --> 00:49.920
and then you've got a table that lists your skills

14
00:50.100 --> 00:52.650
as well as the number of stars that you would rate yourself.

15
00:52.980 --> 00:54.150
And to get bonus points,

16
00:54.180 --> 00:58.200
you can also use tables to affect the layout of your skills.

17
00:58.260 --> 01:03.150
So you end up separating your skills into two columns and making it look a

18
01:03.150 --> 01:07.620
little bit like this. And this is what you should end up with or rather

19
01:07.620 --> 01:09.330
this is what you're aiming for.

20
01:09.390 --> 01:14.010
So I've added an extra skill so that we have four skills and they are laid out

21
01:14.010 --> 01:15.480
side by side

22
01:15.690 --> 01:19.170
so that there's two columns of these skill sets.

23
01:19.590 --> 01:24.590
And it's really important to note that these two sections should be distinct from

24
01:24.840 --> 01:28.620
each other. So if you added a one pixel border,

25
01:28.980 --> 01:33.980
this is the structure that you will see. Two sets of skills side-by-side, distinct

26
01:34.470 --> 01:37.020
from each other. So if you want to give that challenge a go

27
01:37.060 --> 01:40.500
then this is a good time to pause the video and give it a try.

28
01:40.880 --> 01:40.970
<v 1>Go on. </v>
