Hey.

1
00:01.790 --> 00:04.710
Well done for completing yet another module.

2
00:04.710 --> 00:06.180
This is really exciting.

3
00:06.180 --> 00:08.940
You're getting really into the course now.

4
00:08.940 --> 00:13.820
Now I want to share with you one of my ways for building a good habit.

5
00:13.860 --> 00:20.860
Because if we think about it learning to code, it requires daily, almost constant effort, right?

6
00:20.970 --> 00:28.320
Ideally if you could spend 100 days and you spent one hour a day learning to code or coding something

7
00:28.500 --> 00:35.340
of your own, then you're going to become so much better than if you just, you know, did it one weekend and then forgot

8
00:35.340 --> 00:35.740
about it,

9
00:35.760 --> 00:36.500
right?

10
00:36.570 --> 00:43.830
So the difference between these two scenarios is if you're able to build a habit, and once we have a

11
00:43.830 --> 00:46.730
habit, you almost don't have to think about it anymore,

12
00:46.760 --> 00:47.160
right?

13
00:47.190 --> 00:52.180
You don't think about in the morning like do I want to brush my teeth or not.

14
00:52.380 --> 00:53.510
I don't know.

15
00:53.600 --> 00:58.860
Is it one of those days where I brush or not? You don't think about that because it's a habit.

16
00:58.890 --> 01:00.810
You just wake up, and you just do it.

17
01:01.260 --> 01:06.690
So how can you make coding, or learning to code, a habit?

18
01:06.690 --> 01:15.270
One of the things that really helps me is to mark a line in my calendar, and I think this

19
01:15.270 --> 01:20.510
is actually something that came from Jerry Seinfeld, like the comedian dude, where he said that every

20
01:20.510 --> 01:30.270
day he writes a new joke, he puts a line through, you know, his calendar, and, by continuing that line, at some point

21
01:30.900 --> 01:36.720
you're not going to want to break the chain, because it's like, “Man, I've done like a 10 day streak.

22
01:36.720 --> 01:39.220
How hard is it just to do one more day?”

23
01:39.640 --> 01:46.740
And I don't know if it's because I'm kind of OCD like I just like seeing things like completed.

24
01:46.980 --> 01:53.220
I sometimes just write to do's in my to do list that I've already done which I haven't written in my

25
01:53.220 --> 01:56.190
list but just to be able to tick it off.

26
01:56.190 --> 01:58.420
Yeah yeah let me know if you can relate.

27
01:58.440 --> 02:00.120
But if you even if you can't.

28
02:01.260 --> 02:12.660
Most people actually benefit from continuing a streak and by about 30 days or 40 days that thing that

29
02:12.660 --> 02:18.680
you have to constantly think about, like, “Do I have time today to code?

30
02:19.020 --> 02:26.150
Do I want to do it?” That kind of just becomes a habit and you just know, “Oh, this is the time where I get

31
02:26.300 --> 02:32.900
sat down and I start coding.” And it doesn't actually take that much motivation anymore. So try and give

32
02:32.900 --> 02:35.750
this a go and see if that helps you.

33
02:35.750 --> 02:39.050
But the most important thing is to just keep going.

34
02:39.080 --> 02:44.720
I keep saying it but at the end of the day if you show up if you do the work then you're gonna get the

35
02:44.720 --> 02:45.290
results.

36
02:45.650 --> 02:47.950
So I'm here cheering for you.

37
02:48.050 --> 02:49.480
I'm sure other people are.

38
02:49.730 --> 02:52.090
I think you're doing great and you're going to do even better.
