00:00.870 --> 00:08.760
Now that we've completed the HTML section and we have our completed website, but we can only access

1
00:08.760 --> 00:15.540
it locally because when we open up our index.html, you can see that we're just opening a local file,

2
00:15.540 --> 00:15.810
right?

3
00:16.170 --> 00:21.360
In this case, this file is inside my users folder, inside my username, inside my desktop.

4
00:21.990 --> 00:28.470
But that means nobody else can actually access this website, which makes it a bit pointless, right?

5
00:28.500 --> 00:33.480
The whole point of a website is so that we can put it onto the internet, and everybody will be able

6
00:33.480 --> 00:35.820
to see our personal site or our CV.

7
00:36.390 --> 00:37.820
So how can we do this?

8
00:37.830 --> 00:41.520
Well, in order to do that, we need to host our website somewhere.

9
00:42.780 --> 00:49.530
Now, there's a whole bunch of hosting sites such as GoDaddy or Bluehost, but because we're learning

10
00:49.530 --> 00:52.120
at the moment, we don't want to have to pay for this.

11
00:52.140 --> 00:54.630
So there's also a free solution that

12
00:54.690 --> 01:01.440
I'm going to show you. By the end of this lesson, you're going to have your personal CV up on the internet

13
01:01.830 --> 01:08.190
proudly displayed somewhere and you'll be able to share a URL or a link to it so that anybody across the

14
01:08.190 --> 01:09.900
web can be able to access it.

15
01:10.770 --> 01:15.870
But first thing's first, we'll need to do a little bit of set-up. The service that we're going to use

16
01:15.870 --> 01:21.870
is GitHub, and we're going to talk about GitHub in a lot of detail a little bit later on.

17
01:22.170 --> 01:27.630
It's a really, really useful tool that is pretty much essential to a developer's workflow.

18
01:28.230 --> 01:33.570
But for now, we're only going to use one of its features, which is hosting our website.

19
01:34.080 --> 01:39.780
So first and foremost, if you don't have a GitHub account, then you'll need to set up a new one.

20
01:40.290 --> 01:43.080
So I'm just going to set one up while we're at it.

21
01:44.170 --> 01:46.870
And now it'll ask you to choose a plan.

22
01:46.900 --> 01:51.430
Now we're going to choose the free plan and then we then click Continue.

23
01:52.300 --> 01:56.080
Now I'm going to skip this questionnaire and just click on Skip the Step.

24
01:56.740 --> 02:03.100
Now, once you have signed up to GitHub, it's really important that you go ahead and verify your email

25
02:03.100 --> 02:09.190
address. So check your emails and see if you have something from GitHub and then click on that verify

26
02:09.190 --> 02:09.520
link.

27
02:09.970 --> 02:15.550
And once you've done that, you'll be able to add new repositories to GitHub. If you head over to the

28
02:15.550 --> 02:17.980
upper right corner and just click on the Plus button,

29
02:18.550 --> 02:23.130
and then we're going to create a new repository. This repository

30
02:23.140 --> 02:24.040
I'm just going to call it CV

31
02:24.910 --> 02:29.470
and this is going to be the name of my project and all that a repository

32
02:29.470 --> 02:35.620
is is simply just a folder out there on the cloud that's going to store all of your project related

33
02:35.620 --> 02:36.010
files.

34
02:36.460 --> 02:42.040
And you'll be able to make changes to the files and update the files, and you'll be able to track all

35
02:42.040 --> 02:44.170
of those changes that you've made in the past.

36
02:44.950 --> 02:47.380
Now that we've given our repository a name,

37
02:47.560 --> 02:53.260
then we're going to leave the description as empty and then we're going to keep public selected and

38
02:53.260 --> 02:54.160
then down here

39
02:54.160 --> 02:59.770
make sure that you check this box where we initialize this repository with a README.

40
03:00.220 --> 03:04.330
And it's really, really important that you do this for the next few steps to work.

41
03:04.720 --> 03:09.340
So now that we've done all of that, we're going to go ahead and click on Create Repository.

42
03:11.030 --> 03:16.490
And this will take just a moment, and now you should see a page that looks like this, which means

43
03:16.490 --> 03:22.400
that your repository has been created and the only file that's in your repository is just a README

44
03:22.400 --> 03:22.730
file.

45
03:23.180 --> 03:28.650
What we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and upload our files for our CV website.

46
03:29.150 --> 03:36.170
So now if you bring up the folder which contains your CV website, so the place where you see your

47
03:36.170 --> 03:41.600
index.html, your images folder and any other pages you have, you're going to select

48
03:41.600 --> 03:48.140
all of these and you're going to drag it into this box here and that will upload and add all of them

49
03:48.140 --> 03:50.150
to our online repository.

50
03:50.690 --> 03:55.100
Once that's done, we're going to give this particular version a name.

51
03:55.430 --> 04:04.370
So we'll say that in this version, we added our initial CV website files and then go ahead and click

52
04:04.370 --> 04:12.320
to commit these changes. And that will upload all of those files that we dragged on, and we are now

53
04:12.320 --> 04:14.420
ready to set up our GitHub page.

54
04:14.990 --> 04:21.680
If you head over to the Settings tab here, you'll see that there is a section called Pages.

55
04:22.190 --> 04:29.960
GitHub Pages is designed to host your personal organization or project pages from a GitHub repository.

56
04:30.140 --> 04:31.700
So we already have the repository,

57
04:31.970 --> 04:34.100
we now have to activate pages.

58
04:34.520 --> 04:36.050
So it's currently disabled.

59
04:36.080 --> 04:38.010
All we have to do to enable it

60
04:38.030 --> 04:41.450
we just have to select a source where our files reside.

61
04:41.810 --> 04:46.720
So if you click on this part where it says none, then select main as your branch.

62
04:47.760 --> 04:49.830
And go ahead and click Save.

63
04:50.880 --> 04:57.450
So now GitHub is going to do some behind the scenes stuff, and it's going to be publishing towards

64
04:57.450 --> 05:03.000
a place which is going to be your username.github.io/your project name

65
05:03.300 --> 05:09.690
so that will be your CV. And you can see this is a HTTPS website, so you'll be able to access the

66
05:09.700 --> 05:14.760
site from anywhere across the world as long as you're connected to the internet.

67
05:15.420 --> 05:18.360
Now, this publishing process takes a little while.

68
05:18.510 --> 05:24.000
You'll see that it says your site is published at this address, and if you click on that address,

69
05:24.300 --> 05:27.420
you should be able to see your website show up.

70
05:27.720 --> 05:33.210
Now, if at this point what you see instead is a 404 then that just means that you have to be

71
05:33.210 --> 05:34.530
a little bit more patient.

72
05:35.010 --> 05:41.070
The GitHub servers are probably working overtime and come back in maybe half an hour and check that

73
05:41.070 --> 05:41.940
link again.

74
05:42.450 --> 05:48.500
But once you are done though, then your website should work exactly as it did locally,

75
05:48.900 --> 05:54.930
but now you can go ahead and share this link with anybody you like across the world, and they can access

76
05:54.930 --> 06:01.890
it because it's now hosted on the internet. So you can go ahead and go over to angelabauer.github

77
06:01.890 --> 06:08.070
.io/cv and you too will be able to see this website that I just uploaded and I'm looking

78
06:08.070 --> 06:08.760
at right now.

79
06:09.480 --> 06:15.660
Now, if after half an hour and you click on this link and it still doesn't show your website or there

80
06:15.660 --> 06:21.180
are some inconsistencies on it, then you might have to troubleshoot your setup because you might have

81
06:21.390 --> 06:22.470
made a mistake somewhere.

82
06:23.040 --> 06:29.940
Now, the first thing I want you to check is to go to the Code tab here and make sure that your file,

83
06:30.210 --> 06:32.610
which is your home page, says,

84
06:33.500 --> 06:39.030
is actually called index.html, and it should have a lowercase i

85
06:39.350 --> 06:42.290
and it should be spelled exactly like this.

86
06:42.410 --> 06:48.800
This is very important because GitHub is going to look for a file with this name in order to serve as

87
06:48.800 --> 06:49.670
your home page.

88
06:50.720 --> 06:57.440
So if you don't have that, then go into that file and click on this button and you can edit the name.

89
06:57.770 --> 07:04.130
Now, make sure at the very end you create a message for this change and then click on commit changes.

90
07:04.610 --> 07:11.270
Now, while we're here if you see this DOCTYPE html showing up at the top of your website, you

91
07:11.270 --> 07:14.900
can also edit it here and simply delete that.

92
07:15.290 --> 07:20.330
This is something that is useful for our editor, but not necessarily important if we want to publish

93
07:20.330 --> 07:20.960
the website.

94
07:21.680 --> 07:26.150
Now, another issue that people have is their images don't show up.

95
07:26.900 --> 07:30.230
Now this could be because when you created the home page,

96
07:30.290 --> 07:37.580
so if we look in index.html, the reference for your image, the source, you set it to something

97
07:37.580 --> 07:44.300
local on your computer like C:drive/images, etc. But in this case, we actually have to make

98
07:44.300 --> 07:47.720
this relative to the position of this file.

99
07:48.290 --> 07:54.740
So you can see I'm referring to a folder called images that's on the same hierarchical level as this

100
07:54.740 --> 07:55.550
current file.

101
07:55.820 --> 07:58.460
And then inside that folder, I'm looking for an image

102
07:58.490 --> 08:05.480
called angela.png. Make sure that there are no typos and make sure that you've got all your capitalizations,

103
08:05.480 --> 08:06.560
,lowercase, uppercase?

104
08:06.920 --> 08:08.360
exactly the same.

105
08:08.360 --> 08:12.800
It matters a huge deal to the computer, even though, as humans, we might ignore that.

106
08:13.070 --> 08:17.140
Now, the next thing I've seen students have an issue with is their links don't work.

107
08:17.150 --> 08:23.360
So when they click on my hobbies or when they click on Contact Me, it doesn't link to the correct page.

108
08:23.720 --> 08:28.180
Now again, this would be an issue with our hyperlinks. So you can see this

109
08:28.190 --> 08:36.290
My hobbies links to a href that says hobbies.html, and this is the file that I want it to pull

110
08:36.290 --> 08:36.440
up.

111
08:37.280 --> 08:44.030
Now, if we go back to our file structure, you can see at the same level as index.html inside the same

112
08:44.030 --> 08:44.660
directory,

113
08:44.960 --> 08:47.240
there is a page called hobbies.html,

114
08:47.510 --> 08:54.410
there is a page called contact-me.html, and these are spelled exactly the same as what we've

115
08:54.410 --> 08:54.920
got here.

116
08:54.950 --> 09:00.470
Now I'm stressing this because I've seen so many students fall down here just because maybe they capitalize

117
09:00.470 --> 09:04.400
an h, or maybe they spell this file incorrectly

118
09:04.400 --> 09:10.670
or maybe they spelled this file incorrectly, or maybe they created another folder in here and stored

119
09:10.670 --> 09:17.900
these two files inside. The code has to be able to find out where these files are in order for it to

120
09:17.900 --> 09:18.290
work.

121
09:18.620 --> 09:24.740
Now, the best way to assure that your code actually works is to make sure that you've got the same

122
09:24.740 --> 09:25.460
code as me

123
09:25.460 --> 09:28.340
and you can check this if you go to this link.

124
09:29.210 --> 09:35.510
And if you have the same code in your index.html and you have the same structure here with all the

125
09:35.510 --> 09:38.270
same names, then it should definitely work.

126
09:38.660 --> 09:43.730
Now, if you have any of these problems troubleshooting again, take a look in the Q&A section for this

127
09:43.790 --> 09:44.690
current lesson

128
09:44.990 --> 09:50.840
and in there you should see a featured question where I have added some of my troubleshooting tips for

129
09:50.840 --> 09:52.460
uploading your website to GitHub.

130
09:53.090 --> 09:59.900
So now it's time for you to go through this process and upload your CV and your website onto the World

131
09:59.900 --> 10:06.830
Wide Web and be sure to share a link to your project in the Q&A of this lesson so that we can all admire

132
10:06.830 --> 10:09.320
your hard work and what you have created.

133
10:09.950 --> 10:11.630
So that's all for me for this lesson.

134
10:11.660 --> 10:12.890
I'll see you on the next.
