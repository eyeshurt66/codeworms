00:00.510 --> 00:04.080
All right. So I've added a few more details here and there to

1
00:04.080 --> 00:05.340
this personal site

2
00:05.550 --> 00:09.780
and it's now really coming along and starting to look like a real website that

3
00:09.780 --> 00:12.570
you might come across browsing the web. Now,

4
00:12.570 --> 00:17.070
the next thing that I want to do is when we go to the contact me page,

5
00:17.580 --> 00:21.720
it's a little bit sparse at the moment. It's only got my fictional address,

6
00:21.750 --> 00:24.930
my fictional number and my fictional email. Now,

7
00:24.930 --> 00:28.590
what if I could add a form at the end of this

8
00:29.220 --> 00:32.400
where I allow people to put down their name and their email

9
00:32.850 --> 00:35.820
and they can message me using that form?

10
00:35.880 --> 00:38.570
How would we do that in HTML? So,

11
00:38.750 --> 00:40.850
of course, first place to head to

12
00:40.910 --> 00:45.380
<v 0>is the MDN web docs. And we've got our form element.</v>

13
00:45.680 --> 00:49.430
Now you can read through all of these attributes and start getting an

14
00:49.430 --> 00:53.840
understanding of how a form works and how you can put one together. Now,

15
00:53.870 --> 00:58.580
in order for forms to really come alive and to work as you would expect them

16
00:58.580 --> 01:02.750
to, it actually requires a little bit more than just HTML,

17
01:02.960 --> 01:06.590
because we need to specify the behavior of the form.

18
01:07.010 --> 01:10.850
We can design the form and we can structure the form for our website

19
01:11.180 --> 01:13.460
but until we learn about JavaScript,

20
01:13.490 --> 01:16.700
we won't be able to tap into its full functionality just yet.

21
01:17.720 --> 01:19.310
But we can get pretty close.

22
01:19.550 --> 01:24.200
So let's go ahead and create a brand new form inside our contact-

23
01:24.200 --> 01:28.820
me.html page. Just below the last paragraph tag,

24
01:29.180 --> 01:34.180
let's add a brand new form. And you can see that with the autosuggest

25
01:35.780 --> 01:39.290
these are the default things that come up. Now,

26
01:39.290 --> 01:40.700
I'm going to keep them as they are and

27
01:40.790 --> 01:44.930
we're going to go inside the form tag and we're going to create our first

28
01:44.990 --> 01:45.823
label.

29
01:46.490 --> 01:50.390
Now our first label is simply going to be called your name.

30
01:50.690 --> 01:54.470
So this is where we ask our user for their name input.

31
01:55.040 --> 01:59.480
And in order to store that information or allow them to type that information,

32
01:59.780 --> 02:04.640
we need to add an input and the type of input is going to be text.

33
02:04.880 --> 02:08.120
So it's just going to be a text box that allows them to put in their name.

34
02:08.720 --> 02:13.220
And if we hit save and check out what our website looks like at the moment,

35
02:13.610 --> 02:18.410
then you can see we've got our label here and we've got a box where somebody can

36
02:18.410 --> 02:22.880
type in some inputs. Now the thing that we're missing is a submit button.

37
02:23.540 --> 02:28.540
Now a submit button also falls under the inputs of a form and you can see it

38
02:30.380 --> 02:31.213
right here.

39
02:31.460 --> 02:35.480
It's simply an input instead of having a type of text,

40
02:35.750 --> 02:40.670
it has the type of submit and all you need to do is to change the word text

41
02:41.000 --> 02:45.290
to submit and delete the value attribute and hit

42
02:45.290 --> 02:47.660
save and refresh.

43
02:47.900 --> 02:51.920
You'll see that you get this submit button without having to put in any extra

44
02:51.920 --> 02:55.310
effort. So that's the beauty of some of these form inputs.

45
02:55.850 --> 02:59.030
And we can check out some of the other ones inside the docs by going to the related

46
02:59.440 --> 03:02.920
topics. And there's loads of different types of inputs.

47
03:03.400 --> 03:08.380
There's buttons which are inputs, there's check boxes, color, date.

48
03:08.500 --> 03:11.500
Let's give some of them a try and see what they look like on screen.

49
03:11.920 --> 03:16.030
Just before the submit button, let's add an input that has type

50
03:16.060 --> 03:18.550
maybe color. And of course,

51
03:18.550 --> 03:22.750
remember you have to spell it the American way with a single 'o' instead of

52
03:22.810 --> 03:23.643
'ou'.

53
03:24.040 --> 03:28.810
So let's hit save and refresh and you can see

54
03:28.810 --> 03:32.320
we now have a color picker on our website. And when you click on it,

55
03:32.650 --> 03:37.360
it brings up the color picker where we can select any color we'd like,

56
03:37.660 --> 03:42.070
and you might submit a form that maybe has your favorite color or change the

57
03:42.070 --> 03:44.680
website using a color picker input.

58
03:45.400 --> 03:47.380
Another cool one is the check box.

59
03:47.560 --> 03:52.560
So we can add a checkbox by using input and changing text to check box. Hit

60
03:55.480 --> 04:00.130
save, hit refresh, and you can see, we now have a little check box.

61
04:00.640 --> 04:03.640
So you can have a line break here

62
04:03.670 --> 04:08.230
forcing this to go on to the next line. And let's create a label where it says

63
04:08.290 --> 04:13.290
do you want to sign up to the email list, and hit save, refresh,

64
04:16.900 --> 04:19.660
and you can see you've got this classic checkbox.

65
04:19.690 --> 04:23.110
Do you want to sign up to the email list, check or uncheck and hit submit?

66
04:23.530 --> 04:24.550
Or you can put something like

67
04:24.550 --> 04:28.060
have you read the terms and conditions or any other thing that might fit with a

68
04:28.090 --> 04:28.923
checkbox.

69
04:29.500 --> 04:33.100
Now the last one that I wanted to show you before we proceed was the password

70
04:33.100 --> 04:33.933
input.

71
04:34.210 --> 04:39.210
So let's delete the checkbox and let's add a password input.

72
04:41.170 --> 04:46.120
The cool thing about the password input is that when you type anything inside

73
04:46.120 --> 04:46.953
this box,

74
04:47.080 --> 04:52.080
ideally you'd want a label of course here to show that this is the password.

75
04:54.820 --> 04:59.290
But we know this is a password field because you can either right-click and hit

76
04:59.290 --> 05:00.160
inspect

77
05:00.700 --> 05:05.440
and you'll see that this is our password input or you know that the next thing

78
05:05.440 --> 05:09.400
that comes after the password label is of course the password input.

79
05:09.790 --> 05:12.880
But whenever you type anything in here, by default,

80
05:13.240 --> 05:14.920
everything you type is masked.

81
05:15.160 --> 05:19.900
So these are for fields where you don't want somebody overlooking the user to be

82
05:19.900 --> 05:21.550
able to see what their password is.

83
05:22.240 --> 05:26.710
Feel free to have a bit of fun and try out all of these different input types

84
05:27.190 --> 05:31.960
and see what they look like and see what they do. And once you do that,

85
05:31.960 --> 05:33.430
you'll come to realize that a lot of

86
05:33.430 --> 05:38.430
the things that you see on the web are just very simple HTML inputs.

87
05:38.800 --> 05:43.000
And as we build our knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript,

88
05:43.270 --> 05:47.620
we're going to come back and see how forms work in more detail.

89
05:47.770 --> 05:51.550
So have an explore of have that and see what they all look like when you just add

90
05:51.550 --> 05:52.420
them to your website,

91
05:52.660 --> 05:55.600
but we'll experience the full functionality a little bit later on.

92
05:56.230 --> 06:00.350
Now, let's just quickly review what we've learned about HTML forms.

93
06:00.830 --> 06:05.830
We use the form tag to define what should go into our form and this by itself

94
06:07.250 --> 06:11.270
doesn't actually do anything. So in order for the form to do anything,

95
06:11.480 --> 06:16.480
you'll need two important HTML elements and that's the label and the input.

96
06:17.420 --> 06:19.610
And between the opening and closing label tags,

97
06:19.820 --> 06:24.820
you can write some text that will be displayed as a label inside your form.

98
06:25.370 --> 06:30.370
The next most important HTML element that's associated with forms are the inputs.

99
06:31.010 --> 06:33.890
And the input is a self-closing tag

100
06:34.040 --> 06:36.080
so it doesn't have a closing tag.

101
06:36.440 --> 06:41.440
Instead, you can define the input type by using the type attribute

102
06:42.170 --> 06:46.940
and there's a whole bunch of input types that you can tap into to use inside

103
06:46.940 --> 06:51.230
your form. For example, in this case, the type is set to text.

104
06:51.530 --> 06:55.520
So we get a textbox where the user can input their name.

105
06:55.850 --> 07:00.850
But you can also use an input element that has the type attribute set as submit

106
07:02.690 --> 07:04.670
and this creates a button.

107
07:04.910 --> 07:09.410
So you can see that by setting the attribute type to various predefined key

108
07:09.410 --> 07:14.120
words, you actually end up with completely different things on your website.

109
07:14.480 --> 07:19.480
And it might seem strange that even though we're using the same HTML element,

110
07:20.180 --> 07:21.290
i.e. the input,

111
07:21.500 --> 07:25.160
we're actually getting completely different objects on our website,

112
07:25.400 --> 07:27.890
anywhere from textboxes, to buttons

113
07:27.890 --> 07:32.870
to color pickers and a myriad array of different things that we can create just

114
07:32.870 --> 07:35.540
by changing that type. Now,

115
07:35.540 --> 07:38.720
aside from just the text and submit input types,

116
07:38.930 --> 07:40.670
if you have a look at the MDN docs,

117
07:40.670 --> 07:44.240
you'll see that there's loads more different keywords that you can use.

118
07:44.450 --> 07:44.990
For example,

119
07:44.990 --> 07:49.820
the input type where you allow the user to upload a file or the date picker or

120
07:49.820 --> 07:52.070
the radio button or a range.

121
07:52.310 --> 07:57.310
And you can see that I've only got static images in my slide to show you what

122
07:57.530 --> 07:58.363
they look like.

123
07:58.730 --> 08:03.730
But I want you to look through the MDN documentation for the input HTML element

124
08:05.030 --> 08:10.030
and I want you to create a new HTML file that you're going to put onto your

125
08:10.220 --> 08:15.220
desktop and you can open it in order to see it live in action.

126
08:15.320 --> 08:19.790
For example, the date picker now works and my range can be toggled.

127
08:19.820 --> 08:21.680
I can switch my radio button on,

128
08:21.950 --> 08:24.920
I can choose a file and a whole bunch of things.

129
08:25.100 --> 08:27.560
So use it as a living notebook, if you will.

130
08:30.700 --> 08:33.970
That should've been really easy and just to quickly show you,

131
08:34.180 --> 08:38.830
this is what you could have created in order to achieve this. Now at the moment,

132
08:39.040 --> 08:44.040
we're not yet looking into the other attributes for our form or for our inputs.

133
08:44.860 --> 08:49.860
And we're only changing the type attribute to some of these predefined keywords

134
08:51.640 --> 08:55.800
that you can see are listed on the MDN developer docs.

135
08:56.460 --> 08:57.420
In the next lesson,

136
08:57.450 --> 09:02.450
we'll look closer at how forms work and how you can capture and reveal what the

137
09:03.000 --> 09:07.650
user has chosen for each of the inputs. So for all of that and more,

138
09:07.710 --> 09:08.940
I'll see you on the next lesson.
